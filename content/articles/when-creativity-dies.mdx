There was a time when ideas came. When making something—anything—felt natural, even necessary. When you could lose hours in the flow of creation.

Now there's nothing. The well is dry. The spark is out. You stare at the blank page, the empty canvas, the silent instrument, and feel... nothing.

This isn't writer's block. This is deeper. Creativity itself feels dead.

But it isn't. It's just sleeping. And sleep, even the deepest sleep, eventually ends.

## What Kills Creativity

Before we talk about resurrection, let's acknowledge what probably happened:

**Criticism landed too hard.** Someone's judgment—maybe your own—convinced a part of you that creating was dangerous. So it stopped.

**Perfectionism strangled play.** When everything has to be good, nothing gets made. The critical voice got louder than the creative one.

**Life overwhelmed everything.** Survival mode doesn't leave room for creation. When you're just trying to get through each day, art feels like a luxury.

**Burnout consumed the fuel.** Maybe you pushed too hard, demanded too much of your creativity. It gave until there was nothing left to give.

**Trauma froze the flow.** Sometimes creativity stops because feeling stops. And creation requires feeling.

**You forgot why you create.** External measures—success, recognition, money—replaced the intrinsic joy. When those aren't present, neither is motivation.

Identifying what happened isn't about blame. It's about understanding what needs healing.

## The Smallest Creative Acts

You don't need to make art right now. You just need to make something. Anything.

**True low-stakes creativity:**
- Doodle while on a phone call
- Rearrange objects on your desk
- Take a photo of something you find interesting
- Write three sentences about your morning
- Hum a tune while doing dishes
- Cook something without following a recipe exactly

These aren't art. They're not supposed to be. They're just tiny acts of making, choosing, expressing. Warming up the muscle without asking it to lift anything heavy.

## Allowing Terrible Work

Here's the truth: your first creative work after a long silence will probably be bad. That's fine. That's expected. That's *necessary*.

Badness is the price of return. If you wait until you can make something good, you'll wait forever. The path back to good work goes directly through bad work.

So make something bad. Make something you'd be embarrassed for anyone to see. Make something that fails at everything it tries to do.

Then make something else.

## Input Before Output

When the creative well is dry, it might not need more pumping. It might need refilling.

**Ways to fill the well:**
- Consume art in forms different from what you create
- Go somewhere you've never been (even just a new neighborhood)
- Read poetry (especially if you're not a poet)
- Listen to music that moves you
- Watch how children play
- Spend time in nature without agenda
- Have conversations about ideas (not logistics)

You're not procrastinating. You're gathering. Creation requires material, and if you've been running on empty, there's no shame in refueling.

## Separating Creation from Performance

Part of what kills creativity is the merging of *making* and *being judged*. When every creative act is immediately evaluated, the spontaneous part of creativity shuts down.

Try creating without any possibility of sharing:
- Write and immediately delete
- Paint and paint over
- Play music with the recording app closed
- Dance where no one can see

There will be time for polish and performance later. Right now, you're just remembering what it feels like to make something without stakes.

## The Function of Creative Blocks

Sometimes the block is protecting you from something. Not all blocks are problems to solve—some are signals to heed.

Questions worth asking:
- What would happen if I succeeded creatively right now?
- What would I have to face if I finished my project?
- Is there something I'm afraid to express?
- Is my creativity tangled up with someone else's expectations?

Sometimes the block lifts when you address what's underneath it, rather than trying to force through it.

## When You're Not Sure You're Creative At All

Maybe you've convinced yourself you're not actually creative. That was just a phase, a delusion, wishful thinking.

This is rarely true.

Creativity isn't a fixed trait—it's a human capacity. Everyone creates. Children create constantly before they're taught not to. The question isn't whether you're creative, but whether you've been allowed to create.

What did you make as a child, before you learned about talent and judgment and markets? What would you make if no one would ever see it?

That's where your creativity lives. It's still there.

## The Long Road Back

Creative recovery isn't usually dramatic. It's not a breakthrough followed by a flood of work. It's more like spring: gradual, with false starts, eventually undeniable.

What the journey might look like:
1. **Tiny acts** of making anything
2. **Permission** to make bad things
3. **Input** to refill the well
4. **Privacy** to create without judgment
5. **Small completions** of minor projects
6. **Gradual increase** in ambition
7. **Return** to the work that matters

This takes time. Months, maybe years. But each step is itself creative, each day of showing up rebuilds the identity of someone who makes things.

## What You're Not

You're not someone who "used to be creative." Creativity doesn't work that way. It contracts and expands. It goes dormant and awakens.

The fact that you're reading this—that you care that creativity feels dead—proves it's still alive somewhere. Dead things don't hurt. Only living things do.

## An Invitation

Today, make something. Not something good. Not something meaningful. Just something.

Write three lines about the light in your room. Stack some objects in a pleasing way. Whistle a made-up tune. Take a photo that's just for you.

Then tomorrow, make something else.

You're not trying to create a masterpiece. You're trying to remember that you're someone who creates. That the spark isn't gone—it's just been waiting for you to tend it again.

It's still there. You're still there. And the making can begin again, one tiny thing at a time.
