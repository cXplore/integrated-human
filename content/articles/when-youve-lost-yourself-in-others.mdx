There's a particular kind of exhaustion that comes from always being what others need. From shape-shifting so often you've forgotten your original form. From giving so much that you don't know what you'd keep if you could keep anything.

If you're reading this, maybe you're starting to realize: somewhere along the way, you lost yourself. In a relationship. In your family. In being needed. And now you're not sure who you are when you're not taking care of someone else.

This isn't dramatic. This is what happens when boundaries never form, or erode over time, until there's nothing left that's just yours.

## How This Happens

No one wakes up deciding to lose themselves. It happens gradually, often starting in childhood:

- You learned that love was conditional on being useful
- Your needs were dismissed or punished
- You were parentified—taking care of adults who should have cared for you
- You discovered that keeping others happy kept you safe
- Your feelings and preferences never seemed to matter as much as others'

Over time, this becomes automatic. You anticipate needs. You adjust. You perform. And the person who has their own wants, their own limits, their own voice—that person gets smaller and smaller until you can barely hear them.

## What Collapse Looks Like Here

Boundary collapse isn't always obvious. It might look like:

- Saying yes when you mean no (over and over)
- Not knowing what you want until someone else tells you
- Feeling guilty for having needs
- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Resentment you feel ashamed of
- Not being able to identify your emotions
- Panic when someone is upset with you
- Relationships that consume you completely

You might look functional. You might be praised for being so giving, so selfless, so easy. Inside, you might be dying.

## The Truth Nobody Tells You

Here's what took me years to understand: **Boundaries aren't mean. Self-abandonment is.**

Every time you override your needs for someone else, you're telling yourself: "You don't matter." Every time you say yes when you mean no, you're lying—to them and to yourself.

This isn't generosity. It's self-betrayal.

And the people who benefit from your boundarylessness aren't being served either. They're being denied the chance to know the real you, to meet you as an equal, to love someone who isn't performing.

## What Might Help Right Now

You can't rebuild boundaries overnight. But you can start noticing.

**Start with sensation.**
Before you say yes to anything today, pause. What does your body say? Tight? Open? Contracted? Reaching forward? Pulling back?

Your body knows what you want. You've just learned to override it.

**Practice disappointment.**
Let someone be disappointed today. Something small. Say you can't make it, say you don't have time, say you'll think about it. Watch what happens.

Most likely: they'll be fine. And if they're not—that information is useful too.

**Find one thing that's yours.**
One preference that belongs to you, that you don't adjust for anyone. Maybe it's how you take your coffee. A song you love. A show you watch alone. Start here.

**Name the resentment.**
If you feel resentful, don't shame yourself. Resentment is information. It says: "Something here isn't fair. Something in me is being asked for too much." Listen to it.

## The Grief Underneath

When you've lost yourself in others, finding yourself again involves grief. Grief for:
- The years you spent disappearing
- The relationship you might have had with yourself
- The people who couldn't love you without consuming you
- The parent who should have seen you, not used you
- The person you might have become

This grief is real. It deserves space. You don't have to rush through it.

## What Recovery Looks Like

Learning boundaries when you never had them is learning a new language. It's awkward at first. You'll overcorrect. You'll feel guilty. People might be confused—they're used to the version of you that always said yes.

But slowly:
- You'll start knowing what you want
- You'll say no and survive the guilt
- You'll have energy for yourself
- You'll feel solid in a way you never have
- You'll be able to love without losing yourself

This is possible. Even for you.

## A Permission Slip

If you need permission, here it is:

You're allowed to have limits.
You're allowed to disappoint people.
You're allowed to rest without earning it.
You're allowed to not know what you want.
You're allowed to change your mind.
You're allowed to leave relationships that require you to disappear.
You're allowed to take up space.
You're allowed to exist for yourself.

You always were. Someone just forgot to tell you.
