Right now, you might be feeling things so intensely that reading even these words is hard. That's okay. You don't have to read this all at once. You can come back.

If you're here, something has probably broken open. Maybe you're crying and can't stop. Maybe rage is shaking through your body. Maybe you're cycling between emotions so fast you can't name any of them. Maybe you just feel raw, like you have no skin.

This is collapse in the emotional dimension. And while it's terrifying, it's also human. Your nervous system is doing exactly what it's designed to do when it perceives too much, too fast.

## What's Actually Happening

When emotions overwhelm us, it's not a character flaw. It's a capacity issue. Right now, more is coming in than you can process. Think of it like a river after heavy rain—the water isn't bad, there's just too much of it for the banks to hold.

Your nervous system has switched to emergency mode. This might look like:
- Emotions that feel physical—chest tight, stomach churning, shaking
- Thoughts that race or scatter
- Feeling unable to do basic things
- Wanting to escape your own body
- Numbness alternating with intensity

None of this means you're broken. It means you're human, and right now, your humanity is very loud.

## What Might Help Right Now

Not later. Right now. Pick the smallest one that feels possible.

**If you can't feel your body:**
Put your feet flat on the floor. Press them down. Feel the pressure. That's gravity. You're still here.

**If you're shaking or want to move:**
Let your body shake. It's trying to discharge energy. Shake your hands, stamp your feet, move however you need to.

**If you're crying and can't stop:**
You don't have to stop. Crying is your body releasing what it can't hold. Get tissues, get water, let it come.

**If you feel nothing (numb):**
Hold something cold—ice cube, cold water on your wrists. The sensation can help bring you back.

**If you're having thoughts of hurting yourself:**
This is the pain trying to find an exit. You need support right now. Please reach out: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US), Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741.

## What This Isn't

This moment—this flood—isn't:
- A sign that you'll always feel this way
- Evidence that you're too sensitive
- Proof that something is fundamentally wrong with you
- The whole truth about who you are

This is a moment. A hard one. But moments end.

## The Smallest Next Step

When you're drowning, you don't swim to shore. You float. You conserve energy. You wait for the water to calm.

What's the smallest thing you can do to float right now?

Maybe it's:
- Lying down
- Calling one person
- Going outside for thirty seconds
- Taking a shower
- Putting on soft clothes
- Saying out loud: "This is hard and I'm doing my best"

Pick one. Just one.

## A Gentle Truth

People who feel deeply often experience more collapse. This isn't weakness—it's the flip side of capacity. The same nervous system that can be overwhelmed by pain can also be overwhelmed by beauty, love, meaning.

You're not too much. The world is a lot, and you feel it.

Right now, that might not be comforting. That's okay. File it away for later, when the flood has passed and you're rebuilding the banks.

## When This Keeps Happening

If emotional overwhelm is frequent for you, there are ways to build capacity. Not to feel less, but to have more room for what you feel. Somatic therapy, nervous system work, emotional skills training—these help.

But that's for later. For now, just get through this moment. Then the next one.

You're still here. That matters.
