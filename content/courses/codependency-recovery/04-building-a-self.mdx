## The Core Work

Codependency recovery isn't primarily about stopping codependent behaviors. It's about building what's missing.

What's missing is a self. A solid sense of who you are, what you value, what you need—independent of any relationship.

This module is about construction. Building the internal foundation that makes codependent patterns unnecessary.

---

## What Is a "Self"?

A solid self includes:

### Internal Knowing
You know:
- What you feel
- What you want
- What you think
- What you value
- What you need

This knowing doesn't depend on asking others. It's internal reference, not external reference.

### Internal Validation
You can:
- Approve of yourself without others' approval
- Know you're okay without reassurance
- Trust your own perceptions
- Be comfortable with your own decisions

Your worth doesn't fluctuate with others' opinions.

### Differentiation
You can:
- Be close to others without losing yourself
- Have your own feelings even when others feel differently
- Maintain your position in the face of pressure
- Be separate AND connected

You're not merged or isolated—you're differentiated.

### Boundaries
You have:
- A clear sense of where you end and others begin
- The ability to say no
- Protection for your time, energy, values
- Responsibility for your own life, not others'

Boundaries define and protect the self.

## Building Internal Reference

The first task: learning to know yourself from the inside.

### Feelings Practice

Codependents often don't know what they feel. Start rebuilding this capacity.

**The Check-In:**
Multiple times daily, pause and ask: "What am I feeling right now?"

Don't analyze or fix—just identify. Name the feeling.

If you don't know, that's okay. Start with: "Something is going on in my body. It's in my chest. It feels tight. Maybe it's anxiety. Maybe it's sadness."

Build the pathway between sensation and naming.

**Feeling Vocabulary:**
Expand your vocabulary. Not just "bad" or "good" but:
- Sad, disappointed, melancholy, grief
- Angry, irritated, frustrated, enraged
- Afraid, anxious, worried, terrified
- Happy, content, joyful, peaceful
- Lonely, rejected, abandoned, isolated

The more precise your language, the more access you have to your inner world.

### Wants and Needs Practice

Codependents lose track of what they want. Start reclaiming it.

**Daily Wants:**
Each morning, ask: "What do I want today?"

Not what you should want. Not what others want you to want. What do YOU want?

Start small: "I want coffee. I want quiet. I want to wear this."

Then bigger: "I want to spend time on my project. I want to have a real conversation. I want rest."

**The Pause Before Responding:**
When someone asks you something, pause before answering.

"What do you want for dinner?" → [PAUSE] Check inside. What do you actually want?

"Do you want to come to this event?" → [PAUSE] Do you? Really?

The pause breaks the automatic response and creates space for inner knowing.

### Opinion Practice

Know what you think.

**Form opinions before hearing others:**
When a topic comes up, notice what YOU think before hearing others' views. You can change your mind after—but start with your own position.

**Practice stating opinions:**
Say "I think..." and complete the sentence. Even on small things. "I think this movie is boring." "I think that's a good idea." "I think I disagree."

## Building Internal Validation

The shift from external to internal source of worth.

### The Validation Shift

Notice when you seek external validation:
- Asking if something is okay when you know it is
- Needing praise to feel good about work
- Checking others' reactions before knowing your own
- Requiring agreement to trust your view

Then practice: give yourself what you're seeking outside.

**"I did well"** (without needing others to say it)
**"I know what I know"** (without needing confirmation)
**"I'm okay"** (without reassurance)

This feels strange at first. Keep practicing.

### Self-Approval Practice

Start noticing things you do well. Acknowledge them to yourself.

Not arrogance—just honest recognition.

"I handled that conversation well."
"I made a good decision there."
"I showed up for myself today."

Codependents are often expert at self-criticism and incompetent at self-approval. This is retraining.

### Sitting with Disapproval

You will encounter disapproval. Practice tolerating it.

**Sit with the discomfort:**
When someone is disappointed, upset, or disapproving of you, notice your urge to fix it immediately. Notice the anxiety. And sit with it without acting.

Their feelings are theirs. You don't have to change them.

**Separate behavior from worth:**
Maybe you did something wrong. That doesn't mean you ARE wrong. Mistakes don't erase your worth. You can be imperfect and still valuable.

## Building Boundaries

Boundaries are the container that protects the self you're building.

### What Boundaries Actually Are

Boundaries are NOT:
- Walls that keep everyone out
- Punishment for others
- Controlling others' behavior
- Silent suffering until you explode

Boundaries ARE:
- Clear communication of your limits
- Protection of your time, energy, and values
- Responsibility for your own experience
- Saying no when you mean no

### Types of Boundaries

**Physical:** Your body, personal space, physical touch
**Emotional:** What emotional labor you take on, how others speak to you
**Time:** How you spend your time, when you're available
**Mental:** Your right to your own thoughts and opinions
**Material:** Your belongings, your money
**Sexual:** Your consent, your comfort level

### How to Set Boundaries

1. **Identify the boundary needed:** What limit needs to be communicated?

2. **State it clearly:** "I don't want..." or "I need..." or "It's not okay with me when..."

3. **Don't over-explain:** You don't need to justify your boundaries. "No" is a complete sentence.

4. **Allow the discomfort:** They might be upset. That's okay. Their feelings are theirs to manage.

5. **Hold the boundary:** Follow through. Boundaries stated but not held become meaningless.

### Common Boundary Challenges

**"But they'll be upset."**
Yes, possibly. Their upset is not your emergency. You can care about their feelings without taking responsibility for them.

**"It feels selfish."**
Boundaries aren't selfish—they're self-respecting. You're allowed to have limits.

**"I don't know what my boundaries are."**
Pay attention to resentment. It usually signals a boundary violation. When you feel resentful, ask: "What's the limit here that I didn't communicate or hold?"

**"What if they leave?"**
If someone leaves because you have healthy boundaries, they were not a healthy person for you. Boundaries are a filter.

## Building Identity

Who are you, outside of relationships?

### Values Clarification

**What do you value?**
Not what you should value. Not what others value. What matters to YOU?

Some possibilities:
- Creativity, freedom, adventure
- Security, stability, tradition
- Connection, family, community
- Achievement, excellence, growth
- Justice, fairness, contribution
- Spirituality, meaning, depth

Identify your top 5-7 values. These become a compass for decisions.

### Your Own Interests

**What interests you?**
Not your partner's interests that you adopted. Not what's acceptable in your family. What genuinely engages YOU?

Make a list. Include things you've let go of. Include things you've always wanted to try.

Then: do some of them. Have a life of your own.

### Alone Time Practice

Codependents often fear being alone. The emptiness feels unbearable.

**Practice being alone:**
Start small. Fifteen minutes. No distractions.

What comes up? Anxiety? Emptiness? Restlessness?

Stay with it. You're building capacity to be with yourself.

Increase duration over time. Eventually, solitude becomes resource, not threat.

## The Long Process

Building a self takes time. You're reversing patterns that have been running for years or decades.

Be patient. Be persistent. Celebrate small wins.

Every time you:
- Check in with your feelings
- State what you want
- Hold a boundary
- Spend time on your own interests
- Sit with discomfort instead of immediately fixing

...you're building the self that was never fully developed.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Internal reference:** Knowing yourself from the inside, not by reading others
- **Internal validation:** Approving of yourself without external confirmation
- **Differentiation:** Being close without losing yourself
- **Boundaries:** Clear limits that protect your self
