## Getting Specific

General understanding of codependency is useful. But real change requires seeing YOUR specific patterns with precision.

This module is a deep dive into how codependency manifests in your life—your behaviors, your beliefs, your relationship patterns. The goal is a map so clear you can't not see it.

---

## Behavioral Patterns

Let's catalog the specific behaviors that make up codependency.

### In Relationships

**Overgiving:**
- Giving more than you can afford (time, energy, money)
- Giving without being asked
- Giving to feel worthy
- Feeling resentful after giving (but continuing to give)

**Fixing and Rescuing:**
- Trying to solve others' problems
- Giving advice constantly
- Taking over when others struggle
- Not allowing others to experience consequences

**Caretaking:**
- Managing others' emotions
- Anticipating needs before they're expressed
- Walking on eggshells
- Making yourself responsible for others' happiness

**Disappearing:**
- Abandoning your own plans/preferences
- Going along with whatever others want
- Not expressing opinions
- Losing yourself in the other person

**Tolerating mistreatment:**
- Staying when you should leave
- Making excuses for bad behavior
- Not holding others accountable
- Accepting treatment you know isn't okay

### With Yourself

**Self-abandonment:**
- Ignoring your own needs
- Not making time for self-care
- Putting yourself last, always
- Not knowing what you need

**Self-criticism:**
- Harsh internal dialogue
- Blaming yourself for relationship problems
- Never feeling good enough
- Taking responsibility for others' behavior

**Avoidance:**
- Not dealing with your own issues
- Using focus on others to escape yourself
- Not pursuing your own goals
- Neglecting your own development

### In Communication

**People-pleasing speech:**
- Saying what others want to hear
- Agreeing when you don't
- Apologizing excessively
- Prefacing everything with qualifiers

**Indirect communication:**
- Hinting instead of asking directly
- Expecting others to read your mind
- Not saying what you mean
- Saying yes when meaning no

**Conflict avoidance:**
- Not raising issues
- Backing down immediately in disagreement
- Peace at any price
- Suppressing anger

## Belief Patterns

Underlying the behaviors are beliefs—often unconscious assumptions that drive everything.

### About Worth

- "I'm only valuable if I'm helping"
- "My needs don't matter as much as others'"
- "I'm too much / not enough"
- "I have to earn love"
- "I don't deserve good things"

### About Relationships

- "If I'm not needed, I'll be abandoned"
- "Love means sacrifice"
- "Other people's feelings are my responsibility"
- "Conflict means the relationship is ending"
- "I have to keep everyone happy"

### About Needs

- "Having needs is selfish"
- "I shouldn't need help"
- "My needs are a burden"
- "If I need something, I'm weak"
- "Other people's needs come first"

### About Self

- "Who I really am isn't acceptable"
- "I don't know who I am without a relationship"
- "I can't trust my own perceptions"
- "My feelings aren't valid"
- "I'm not capable of taking care of myself"

---

## Emotional Patterns

Codependency creates characteristic emotional patterns:

### Anxiety
- About others' states
- About the relationship
- About being abandoned
- About being "found out" as inadequate

### Resentment
- From giving too much
- From not having needs met
- From feeling used
- That you suppress because it's "not okay to feel"

### Emptiness
- When alone
- When not needed
- When not in relationship
- A vague sense of not quite existing

### Guilt
- For having needs
- For saying no
- For taking care of yourself
- For others' unhappiness (even when not your doing)

### Fear
- Of abandonment
- Of conflict
- Of being truly seen
- Of being alone

---

## Relationship Patterns

Codependency creates recurring relationship dynamics:

### Attraction to Unavailable People
- Emotionally unavailable partners
- Addicts or people with serious issues
- People who need rescuing
- The "I can fix them" impulse

### The Dance of Pursuit and Distance
- Pursuing when they pull away
- Feeling anxious without constant connection
- The relationship feeling like work
- Never quite feeling secure

### Enmeshment
- Losing yourself in the relationship
- Difficulty with separateness
- Your mood depending on theirs
- Not having a life outside the relationship

### Enabling
- Protecting others from consequences
- Making excuses for bad behavior
- Covering up for others
- Helping in ways that perpetuate problems

### The Rescuer-Victim-Persecutor Triangle
- You start as rescuer (helping)
- Become victim (when help isn't appreciated or reciprocated)
- Become persecutor (resentful, critical)
- Round and round

## Seeing the Pattern

Now step back and look at what you've mapped.

Notice the coherence. The behaviors, beliefs, and emotions aren't random—they're a pattern. They connect. They reinforce each other.

The belief "I'm only valuable if helping" drives the behavior of overgiving, which creates the emotion of resentment, which you suppress because of the belief that "my feelings don't matter," which leads to the behavior of self-abandonment, which reinforces the belief that "I don't matter."

**It's a system.** And systems can be changed—but you have to see them first.

---

## From Recognition to Change

Recognition is the first step. But it's only the first step.

In Module 4, we'll begin the work of building what's missing—a solid self. This is the antidote to codependency: not just stopping codependent behaviors, but developing the sense of self that makes them unnecessary.

Before moving on, complete the full inventory. Be honest, even when it's uncomfortable.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Behavioral patterns:** Specific actions that constitute codependency
- **Belief patterns:** Underlying assumptions that drive behaviors
- **Emotional patterns:** Characteristic feelings that accompany codependency
- **Relationship patterns:** Recurring dynamics in relationships
- **System view:** All elements connect and reinforce each other

*When you can see a pattern clearly, you're no longer fully inside it. Seeing is the beginning of freedom.*
