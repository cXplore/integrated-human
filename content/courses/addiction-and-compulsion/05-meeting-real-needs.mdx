## The Alternative Question

In Module 2, you identified what need your addiction is trying to meet. Now we work on the crucial follow-up:

**How else can you meet that need?**

You can't just remove an addiction. You have to replace it—with something that genuinely meets the underlying need, without the harmful consequences.

## The Needs Beneath Addictions

Let's revisit the common needs addictions serve, with healthy alternatives for each:

### Need: Emotional Regulation

**If your addiction helps you manage overwhelming emotions:**

**Healthy alternatives:**
- Nervous system regulation practices (breathing, cold water, movement)
- Emotional processing with a therapist
- Journaling to express and release
- Physical exercise for stress relief
- Time in nature for calming
- Crying, shaking, or other natural releases

### Need: Connection

**If your addiction provides pseudo-intimacy or escape from loneliness:**

**Healthy alternatives:**
- Authentic relationships (even one is enough to start)
- Support groups (AA, SMART Recovery, or others)
- Therapy relationship
- Community involvement
- Volunteering
- Pet companionship
- Regular contact with safe people

### Need: Pleasure and Reward

**If your addiction is your main source of feeling good:**

## Building a Pleasure Portfolio

Many people in recovery realize: "I don't know how to feel good without my addiction."

You need a **pleasure portfolio**—multiple sources of genuine pleasure and reward that don't harm you.

This isn't hedonism. It's recognition that humans need pleasure, and if you don't have healthy sources, you'll return to harmful ones.

<Exercise title="Your Pleasure Portfolio">

<Journal
  id="pleasure-inventory"
  prompt="List everything that brings you genuine pleasure, joy, or good feelings—without harmful consequences. Include small and large things."
  placeholder="Things that bring me genuine pleasure:&#10;&#10;Small daily pleasures:&#10;&#10;Bigger pleasures:&#10;&#10;Things I used to enjoy:&#10;&#10;Things I'd like to try:"
  rows={10}
/>

<Checklist
  id="pleasure-categories"
  title="Which pleasure categories do you need more of?"
  items={[
    "Physical pleasure (movement, touch, sensations)",
    "Creative expression (making things)",
    "Intellectual stimulation (learning, thinking)",
    "Social connection (people, belonging)",
    "Nature and beauty (outdoors, aesthetics)",
    "Play and fun (games, humor, spontaneity)",
    "Rest and relaxation (calm, peace)",
    "Adventure and novelty (new experiences)",
    "Accomplishment (achieving, mastering)",
    "Meaning and purpose (contribution, impact)"
  ]}
/>

## The Early Recovery Problem

Here's a difficult truth: in early recovery, alternatives often don't feel as good as the addiction.

Why? Because:
- Your dopamine system is dysregulated from the addiction
- Natural pleasures feel muted compared to artificial highs
- You haven't practiced feeling good without substances/behaviors
- The alternatives take time and effort

**This is temporary.** Your brain recalibrates. Natural pleasures become pleasurable again. But you have to get through a period where nothing feels as good.

**What helps during this phase:**
- Knowing it's temporary
- Expecting that alternatives will feel "less than" at first
- Stacking pleasures (combining multiple sources)
- Being patient with yourself
- Celebrating small wins
- Support from others

## The Support Question

Addiction thrives in isolation. Recovery requires connection.

You need people who:
- Know what you're struggling with
- Support your recovery
- Can be called when you're struggling
- Won't enable your addiction
- Won't shame you for relapses

This might be:
- A therapist
- A sponsor or mentor
- A support group
- A trusted friend or family member
- An online community
- All of the above

<Exercise title="Building Your Support Network">

<Journal
  id="current-support"
  prompt="Who in your life currently knows about your struggle and supports your recovery?"
  placeholder="People who know and support me:&#10;&#10;People who might be able to support me if I told them:"
  rows={5}
/>

<Journal
  id="support-needs"
  prompt="What support do you need that you're not currently getting? What would help?"
  placeholder="I need...&#10;&#10;It would help to have...&#10;&#10;What I'm missing is..."
  rows={5}
/>

<Checklist
  id="support-actions"
  title="Which support actions will you take?"
  items={[
    "Tell one trusted person about my struggle",
    "Find a therapist who understands addiction",
    "Attend a support group meeting",
    "Reach out to someone who's recovered",
    "Join an online recovery community",
    "Ask someone to be an accountability partner",
    "Create a list of people to call in crisis"
  ]}
/>

## Environment Design

Your environment shapes behavior more than willpower. Set yourself up for success.

**Remove friction for healthy alternatives:**
- Keep exercise clothes visible
- Schedule connection time in calendar
- Have healthy food easily available
- Create a pleasant space for creative activities

**Add friction for addictive behavior:**
- Remove substances from home
- Put the app in a folder on the last screen
- Leave wallet at home
- Tell people so you're accountable
- Change your route to avoid triggers

**Design your default:**
- What will you do when you come home from work?
- What will you do when you're bored?
- What will you do when you're stressed?
- Make the healthy option the easy option.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Genuine Alternatives:** Healthy ways to meet the same need your addiction was serving—not just distraction, but actual need-meeting.

- **Pleasure Portfolio:** Multiple sources of genuine pleasure and reward that don't harm you.
