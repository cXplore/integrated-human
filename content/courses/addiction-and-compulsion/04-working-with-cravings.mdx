## The Craving Moment

There's a moment—sometimes a split second, sometimes a longer window—between the urge arising and acting on it. In that moment, everything is possible.

This module is about expanding that moment and learning to be with cravings without automatically following them.

## What Is a Craving?

A craving is a powerful urge to engage in a behavior or use a substance. It involves:

**Physical sensations:**
- Tension, restlessness
- Tightness in chest or throat
- Butterflies or hollow feeling
- Mouth watering, body pulling toward the object

**Mental components:**
- Thoughts about using/doing
- Justifications and rationalizations
- Fantasy about the relief
- Difficulty thinking about anything else

**Emotional drivers:**
- Anxiety, stress
- Boredom, emptiness
- Loneliness, pain
- Excitement, anticipation

Cravings feel urgent and absolute—like you must act on them. But here's the secret: **cravings always pass.** Every single one. If you don't act on a craving, it peaks and then subsides.

## The Craving Wave

Cravings don't build forever until you explode. They follow a wave pattern:

```
Intensity
    ↑
    │         PEAK
    │        ╱    ╲
    │      ╱        ╲
    │    ╱            ╲
    │  ╱                ╲
    │╱                    ╲_______________
    └─────────────────────────────────────→ Time
        5-10 min    15-20 min    30+ min
```

Most cravings:
- Rise over 5-10 minutes
- Peak for a few minutes
- Subside over 15-20 minutes
- Are mostly gone within 30 minutes

**If you can ride the wave for 30 minutes without acting, the craving will have passed.**

## The STOP Technique

When a craving hits, use STOP:

**S - Stop**
Don't do anything. Pause. Don't reach for your phone, the fridge, the bottle, whatever. Just stop.

**T - Take a breath**
Three slow, deep breaths. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and buys you time.

**O - Observe**
What am I feeling in my body? What emotion is present? What triggered this? Watch the craving with curiosity.

**P - Proceed mindfully**
Now choose. You might still decide to act, but it's a choice, not an automatic reaction.

## Urge Surfing

"Urge surfing" is a mindfulness technique developed by psychologist Alan Marlatt. Instead of fighting cravings, you ride them like a surfer rides a wave.

**How to urge surf:**

1. **Notice the craving** as it arises
2. **Find it in your body.** Where is the urge? What does it feel like physically?
3. **Describe the sensations.** Tightness? Heat? Pulling? Pressure?
4. **Breathe into the area.** Imagine your breath going to where the craving lives
5. **Stay curious.** Notice how the sensations change, move, shift
6. **Keep breathing and observing** as the wave crests and subsides
7. **Acknowledge when it passes.** "That was a craving. I surfed it."

The key insight: **cravings are just body sensations.** They feel urgent, but they're not actually dangerous. You can let them be there without acting.

## The H.A.L.T. Check

Often, cravings are amplified by basic unmet needs. When a craving hits, ask yourself:

**H - Hungry?**
When did I last eat? Is my blood sugar low? Sometimes what feels like a craving for one thing is actually hunger.

**A - Angry?**
Is there unexpressed anger or frustration? Resentment building?

**L - Lonely?**
Have I been isolated? Do I need connection?

**T - Tired?**
Am I exhausted? Depleted? Sleep-deprived?

If you're in any of these states, address the basic need first. Often, the craving diminishes or disappears.

## Playing the Tape Forward

Your brain shows you the fantasy: the first drink, the first bite, the relief, the pleasure. It's seductive.

But you can play the tape forward: What happens after? And after that?

<Exercise title="Playing the Tape Forward">

<Journal
  id="fantasy-vs-reality"
  prompt="When you're craving, what does your brain promise? What's the fantasy?"
  placeholder="My brain shows me...&#10;&#10;It promises I'll feel...&#10;&#10;The fantasy is..."
  rows={5}
/>

<Journal
  id="full-tape"
  prompt="Now play the tape forward. What actually happens after you act on it? Be honest and complete—include the morning after, the consequences, the feelings."
  placeholder="After I [do the thing], what actually happens is...&#10;&#10;An hour later:&#10;&#10;The next morning:&#10;&#10;The consequences include:&#10;&#10;I feel..."
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## Delay and Distract

Sometimes you need a simpler approach: just create time and space between craving and action.

**Delay strategies:**
- "I'll wait 15 minutes"
- "I'll do [one thing] first"
- Set a timer and commit to waiting

**Distraction strategies:**
- Call someone
- Go for a walk
- Do something with your hands
- Take a shower
- Leave the environment
- Do a few minutes of exercise

Delay and distraction aren't the deepest practices, but they work. They buy you time for the craving wave to pass.

## When You Act Anyway

You will sometimes act on cravings despite your best efforts. When this happens:

1. **Don't use it as an excuse to give up.** "I already failed so I might as well keep going" is a trap.

2. **Don't drown in shame.** Shame makes everything worse. Notice it, acknowledge it, don't feed it.

3. **Get curious.** What was happening before? What state was your nervous system in? What need were you trying to meet?

4. **Learn something.** Every relapse contains information. What can you learn for next time?

5. **Return to practice.** The next craving is a new opportunity.
