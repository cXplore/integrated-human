## Welcome to Attachment Repair

Your attachment style—how you learned to bond, connect, and relate—was formed in childhood. But it doesn't have to define your relationships forever.

This course guides you through understanding your attachment patterns and developing what's called "earned secure attachment"—security that wasn't given but can be cultivated.

## What Is Attachment?

Attachment is the deep emotional bond between an infant and their primary caregivers. It's not a choice—it's a biological imperative for survival.

Infants literally cannot survive alone. They need consistent care. So they developed an attachment system—behaviors designed to keep caregivers close: crying, clinging, smiling, reaching.

This system doesn't disappear in adulthood. It just gets directed toward romantic partners, close friends, and others we depend on.

**Your attachment style is how your attachment system works—the patterns, strategies, and expectations you carry into close relationships.**

## How Attachment Forms

Every infant needs:
- **Safety:** Protection from threat
- **Attunement:** Being seen and responded to
- **Consistency:** Reliable, predictable care
- **Repair:** Reconnection after rupture

When these needs are met reliably, secure attachment develops.

When they're not met—or met inconsistently—the nervous system adapts with insecure attachment strategies.

### Secure Attachment Forms When:
- Caregiver is consistently responsive
- Child's distress is met with comfort
- Child's needs are seen and addressed
- There's rupture AND repair
- The child feels safe to explore and return

### Anxious Attachment Forms When:
- Caregiver is inconsistently available
- Sometimes responsive, sometimes not
- Child learns to amplify distress to get needs met
- Attention requires effort or crisis
- The child becomes hypervigilant to caregiver's state

### Avoidant Attachment Forms When:
- Caregiver is emotionally unavailable
- Needs are dismissed or minimized
- Independence is rewarded over connection
- Vulnerability is met with discomfort
- The child learns to suppress needs

### Disorganized Attachment Forms When:
- Caregiver is source of both comfort AND fear
- Abuse, neglect, or severe inconsistency
- No coherent strategy works
- The child experiences approach-avoid conflict
- Results in fragmented relating patterns

## The Four Attachment Styles

### Secure (50-60% of population)
**Core feeling:** "I'm okay, you're okay. We can depend on each other."

**Characteristics:**
- Comfortable with intimacy and independence
- Can ask for needs directly
- Trusts others are reliable
- Handles conflict without destroying connection
- Recovers from relationship stress relatively quickly

### Anxious/Preoccupied (15-20%)
**Core fear:** Abandonment. "I'll be left. I'm too much. I need constant reassurance."

**Characteristics:**
- Hypervigilant to partner's moods and distance
- Seeks closeness, fears rejection
- Needs frequent reassurance
- Difficulty self-soothing when relationship feels threatened
- Tends to put partner's needs above own

### Avoidant/Dismissive (20-25%)
**Core fear:** Engulfment. "I'll lose myself. Others are too needy. I need space."

**Characteristics:**
- Values independence over connection
- Uncomfortable with emotional intimacy
- Pulls away when things get close
- Suppresses attachment needs
- Can seem self-sufficient but may be defended

### Disorganized/Fearful-Avoidant (3-5%)
**Core experience:** Both wanting and fearing intimacy. "I want closeness but it's terrifying."

**Characteristics:**
- Push-pull dynamics
- Approach-avoid behavior
- May idealize then devalue partners
- Difficulty with consistent relating
- Often trauma history

## Why Your Style Persists

Your attachment style tends to persist because:

### 1. Neural Pathways
Early attachment creates neural templates for relationship. These pathways get reinforced with every relationship.

### 2. Internal Working Models
You carry unconscious beliefs about yourself, others, and what to expect from relationships:
- Secure: "I am worthy of love. Others are reliable."
- Anxious: "I'm not quite enough. Others might leave."
- Avoidant: "I don't need much. Others are too needy."
- Disorganized: "Connection is unsafe. I'm confused about what I want."

### 3. Confirmation Bias
We see what we expect. If you expect abandonment, you'll see signs of it everywhere—and sometimes create it.

### 4. Partner Selection
We often choose partners who confirm our attachment patterns:
- Anxious people choose avoidant partners (confirming "I'm too much")
- Avoidant people choose anxious partners (confirming "people are needy")

### 5. Repetition Compulsion
There's an unconscious drive to recreate familiar dynamics—even painful ones—in an attempt to master them.

## The Good News: Attachment Can Change

Your attachment style isn't fixed. Research shows:
- About 50% of people with insecure attachment develop security in adulthood
- New relationships can update attachment templates
- Therapy and conscious work create change
- The brain remains plastic throughout life

**This is called "earned secure attachment"**—security that wasn't given in childhood but was developed through:
- Relationships with secure partners
- Good therapy
- Self-awareness and intentional practice
- Understanding and processing your history

Earned secure attachment is just as valid and functional as security developed in childhood.

## Exercise: Your Attachment History

### Part 1: Early Memories

Reflect on your earliest relationships:

**When you were upset as a child, what happened?**
- Who comforted you?
- How was your distress received?
- What did you learn about expressing needs?

**Describe your relationship with your primary caregiver:**
- How would you characterize it?
- What was available? What wasn't?
- What did you have to do to get your needs met?

**What messages did you receive about:**
- Needing others:
- Being independent:
- Expressing emotions:
- Asking for help:

### Part 2: Initial Style Assessment

Based on what you've read, which style(s) do you most identify with?

- [ ] Secure
- [ ] Anxious
- [ ] Avoidant
- [ ] Disorganized/Mixed

What makes you think so?

### Part 3: Current Patterns

In your current or most recent relationship:

- When you're stressed, do you move toward or away from your partner?
- How do you handle conflict?
- What triggers your biggest reactions?
- What do you need most that's hard to ask for?

## Key Concepts

- **Attachment System:** The biological system that drives us to seek closeness with important others, especially when threatened or stressed.

- **Internal Working Model:** Unconscious templates for relationships formed in childhood—beliefs about self, others, and what to expect.

- **Secure Base:** The function caregivers (and later partners) serve—a safe harbor to return to, allowing exploration of the world.

- **Earned Secure Attachment:** Security developed through conscious work and healthy relationships, rather than received in childhood.

- **Attachment Style:** Your characteristic pattern of connecting, bonding, and relating in close relationships.

## What's Next

In Module 2, we'll dive deep into YOUR specific patterns—not just which style you have, but exactly how it shows up in your relationships. The more precisely you understand your patterns, the more effectively you can work with them.

Before moving on, complete the reflection exercises. Pay attention to your relationships this week through the lens of attachment.

*Your attachment style made sense given your history. Understanding it is the first step to changing it.*
