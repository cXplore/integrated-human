## Welcome to Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand, and skillfully work with emotions—both yours and others'. It's one of the most important skills you can develop.

## Defining Emotional Intelligence

### What It Is

Emotional intelligence (EQ) is:
- The ability to recognize emotions in yourself and others
- Understanding what emotions are telling you
- Managing emotions rather than being controlled by them
- Using emotional information to guide thinking and behavior

### The Four Core Components

**1. Self-Awareness**
Knowing what you're feeling and why. Recognizing your emotional patterns and how emotions affect your behavior.

**2. Self-Regulation**
Managing your emotional responses. Not suppressing emotions, but choosing how to express and act on them.

**3. Empathy**
Recognizing and understanding others' emotions. Seeing situations from their perspective.

**4. Social Skills**
Using emotional awareness to navigate relationships, communicate effectively, and connect with others.
