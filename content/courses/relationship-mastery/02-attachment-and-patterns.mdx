## The Hidden Script

You think you're making free choices in relationships.

But beneath every choice, an invisible script is running—patterns established in your earliest years that shape who you're attracted to, how you behave in love, and what triggers you.

**Understanding your attachment patterns is essential for relationship transformation.**

---

## What Is Attachment?

### The Origin:
Attachment theory (developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth) describes how early experiences with caregivers shape our relational patterns.

### The Core Need:
As infants, we needed to attach to survive. Our nervous system was calibrated by how caregivers responded to our needs.

### The Pattern:
What we learned then becomes our template for adult relationships—our expectations, behaviors, and fears around intimacy.

---

## The Four Attachment Styles

### Secure Attachment (~50-60% of population)
**Formed when:** Caregivers were consistently responsive and attuned.

**In relationships:**
- Comfortable with intimacy and independence
- Can communicate needs clearly
- Trusts partner's love
- Handles conflict constructively
- Offers and receives support easily

**Internal experience:**
"I am worthy of love. Others can be trusted."

---

### Anxious/Preoccupied Attachment (~20%)
**Formed when:** Caregivers were inconsistently available—sometimes responsive, sometimes not.

**In relationships:**
- Fears abandonment
- Needs frequent reassurance
- Sensitive to partner's moods and distance
- May become clingy or demanding
- Hypervigilant for signs of rejection

**Internal experience:**
"I'm not sure I'm lovable enough. Will they leave?"

---

### Avoidant/Dismissive Attachment (~25%)
**Formed when:** Caregivers were emotionally unavailable or rejecting of needs.

**In relationships:**
- Values independence, sometimes to a fault
- Uncomfortable with too much closeness
- May withdraw when partner needs connection
- Difficulty with vulnerability and emotions
- May seem distant or shut down

**Internal experience:**
"I don't need anyone. Depending on others is dangerous."

---

### Disorganized/Fearful-Avoidant (~5%)
**Formed when:** Caregivers were frightening or frightened—source of both comfort and fear.

**In relationships:**
- Wants intimacy but fears it
- May push-pull (come close, then retreat)
- Difficulty trusting
- Often triggered into old trauma
- Relationships feel chaotic

**Internal experience:**
"I want love but it's dangerous. I'm confused about what to do."

## How Attachment Plays Out

### Anxious + Avoidant Dynamic

This is the most common problematic pairing:

**The Dance:**
- Anxious partner seeks closeness → Avoidant feels overwhelmed, withdraws
- Avoidant withdraws → Anxious feels abandoned, pursues harder
- Cycle intensifies until explosion or collapse

**Why They Attract:**
- Anxious confirms avoidant's belief that people are too needy
- Avoidant confirms anxious's belief that people leave
- Both get their wounds reinforced

### Anxious + Anxious
Intense connection, but may become co-dependent and reinforce each other's fears.

### Avoidant + Avoidant
May lack depth; both maintain distance; "roommate" relationships common.

### Secure + Insecure
Secure partner can help stabilize; but insecure patterns may push secure partner away over time.

## Triggers and Activation

### What Gets Triggered:
When our attachment system is activated, we revert to our patterns:
- Anxious: fear of abandonment → pursue, seek reassurance
- Avoidant: fear of engulfment → withdraw, shut down
- Disorganized: fear of both → chaotic response

### Common Triggers:
- Partner seeming distant
- Partner wanting more closeness
- Conflict
- Life transitions
- Stress
- Perceived rejection

### The Reaction:
In trigger, we respond from our primitive attachment brain, not our adult self. We feel young, desperate, reactive.

## The Origin Story

### Your Attachment Was Shaped By:

**Caregiver Patterns:**
- Were they responsive to your needs?
- Were they emotionally available?
- Were they consistent or unpredictable?
- Were they frightening?

**Key Experiences:**
- Major losses or abandonments
- Trauma
- Parental mental health issues
- Family dysfunction

### It Made Sense:
Your attachment pattern was intelligent adaptation to your environment. The problem is you're still running the old program in new situations.

## Partner Selection

### We Don't Choose Randomly:

**The Draw:**
- We're often attracted to partners who fit our patterns
- The familiar feels like home (even if it's unhealthy)
- We unconsciously seek to replay old dynamics
- We're drawn to those who will trigger our wounds

**The Hope:**
Part of us hopes this time it will be different. That we'll finally get the love we needed.

**The Reality:**
Unless we become conscious of the pattern, we repeat it.

## Attachment in Your Current Relationship

### Questions to Consider:
- What attachment styles are present?
- What dynamic do you create together?

- How do you respond when triggered?
- What cycles do you fall into?

### For Singles:
- What patterns do you notice in past relationships?
- What type of partner do you tend to choose?
- What happens as relationships progress?
