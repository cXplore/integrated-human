## Beyond Attachment Labels

You know your attachment style, probably. Anxious. Avoidant. Secure. Disorganized. You took a quiz, read some descriptions, recognized yourself.

That's useful. It's a starting point.

But "I'm anxiously attached" is like "I'm a Sagittarius" — it might resonate, but it's too vague to actually work with. When you're activated in a fight, knowing you're "anxious" doesn't tell you what to do next.

What you need is the high-definition version. Not the category — the specific patterns. Not what anxious people do in general — what YOU do, specifically, in THIS relationship, when triggered by THOSE things.

That's what we build in this module.

## Your Pattern Has a Shape

Every person's relational pattern has a specific architecture:

### Triggers
The specific situations, words, tones, or behaviors that activate your pattern. Not "feeling rejected" in general — what specific things read as rejection to YOUR nervous system?

### Body Response
What happens in your body when triggered. Where do you feel it? What sensations? This is crucial because the body responds before the mind.

### Thoughts
The thoughts that arise when activated. The interpretations. The story you tell yourself.

### Urges
What you want to do. Reach for reassurance? Leave? Attack? Go silent? The impulse, before you act on it.

### Behaviors
What you actually do. Sometimes the same as the urge, sometimes modified. What others actually see.

### Aftermath
What happens after. Do you feel shame? Do you double down? Do you pretend it didn't happen?

## Mapping Your Pattern

Using your observation logs from Week 1, let's map your pattern in detail.

<Exercise title="Pattern Mapping">

### Step 1: Choose 3 Activation Moments

Look at your observation logs. Choose 3 moments when you were triggered — ideally, different situations but with a similar underlying pattern.

<Journal
  id="activation-moments"
  prompt="Describe 3 moments from your observation week when you felt activated:

MOMENT 1:
(What happened, who was involved, context)

MOMENT 2:

MOMENT 3:"
  placeholder="Describe your three activation moments..."
  rows={12}
/>

### Step 2: Map the Body

For each moment, what happened in your body?

<Journal
  id="body-mapping"
  prompt="For each moment, describe the body response:

MOMENT 1 — Body sensations:
(Where did you feel it? Chest? Gut? Throat? Tension? Heat? Cold? Constriction? Agitation?)

MOMENT 2 — Body sensations:

MOMENT 3 — Body sensations:

PATTERN: What's consistent across all three?"
  placeholder="Map your body responses..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Step 3: Map the Thoughts

What thoughts arose when triggered?

<Journal
  id="thought-mapping"
  prompt="For each moment, what thoughts/interpretations arose?

MOMENT 1 — Thoughts:
(What did you think was happening? What did you tell yourself about them? About you? About the relationship?)

MOMENT 2 — Thoughts:

MOMENT 3 — Thoughts:

PATTERN: What's the core thought/belief underneath?"
  placeholder="Map your thought patterns..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Step 4: Map the Urges

What did you want to do?

<Journal
  id="urge-mapping"
  prompt="For each moment, what was the impulse?

MOMENT 1 — What I wanted to do:
(Reach out? Pull away? Confront? Avoid? Check something? Seek reassurance? Create distance? Attack? Defend?)

MOMENT 2 — What I wanted to do:

MOMENT 3 — What I wanted to do:

PATTERN: What's your typical urge when activated?"
  placeholder="Map your impulses..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Step 5: Map the Behaviors

What did you actually do?

<Journal
  id="behavior-mapping"
  prompt="For each moment, what did you actually do?

MOMENT 1 — What I did:

MOMENT 2 — What I did:

MOMENT 3 — What I did:

PATTERN: How well do your behaviors serve you? What do they cost?"
  placeholder="Map your behaviors..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Step 6: Synthesize

<Journal
  id="pattern-synthesis"
  prompt="Looking at all of this, write out your pattern as a sequence:

When [TRIGGER], my body [BODY RESPONSE], I think [THOUGHTS], I feel the urge to [URGE], and I [BEHAVIOR].

Write 2-3 variations if you have different patterns in different situations."
  placeholder="My pattern is..."
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Origin Question

Your pattern didn't come from nowhere. It was an intelligent adaptation to your environment.

<Exercise title="Pattern Origins">

<Journal
  id="pattern-origin"
  prompt="Where did you learn this pattern? When was the first time this response made sense?

Think about:
• Who in your early life required this response from you?
• What happened when you didn't respond this way?
• What were you protecting yourself from?
• What was smart about this adaptation at the time?"
  placeholder="This pattern originated..."
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

---

## The Specific Triggers

Generic triggers aren't useful. "I get triggered by rejection" doesn't help. You need specificity.

<Exercise title="Trigger Specificity">

<Journal
  id="specific-triggers"
  prompt="List your specific triggers — the actual things that activate you:

(Be as specific as possible. Not 'when they're distant' but 'when they respond to my text with one word' or 'when they sigh before answering my question.')

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8."
  placeholder="My specific triggers..."
  rows={16}
/>

</Exercise>

---

## What You Avoid

As important as what triggers you is what you avoid. The conversations you don't have. The truths you don't speak. The needs you don't express.

<Exercise title="Mapping Avoidance">

<Journal
  id="avoidance-patterns"
  prompt="What do you avoid in relationships?

CONVERSATIONS I DON'T HAVE:
(Topics you steer away from, things you don't bring up)

TRUTHS I DON'T SPEAK:
(What's true for you that you don't say)

NEEDS I DON'T EXPRESS:
(What you want but don't ask for)

CONFLICTS I DON'T ENGAGE:
(Issues you let slide, battles you don't pick)

WHY:
(What are you afraid will happen if you didn't avoid these things?)"
  placeholder="What I avoid..."
  rows={16}
/>

</Exercise>

## Your Partner Pattern (If Applicable)

If you're in a relationship, your patterns interact with your partner's patterns. Understanding the dance is as important as understanding your steps.

<Exercise title="The Relational Dance">

<Journal
  id="partner-pattern"
  prompt="If partnered, map the interaction:

WHAT THEY DO THAT TRIGGERS YOU:
(Specific behaviors)

WHAT YOU DO WHEN TRIGGERED:
(Your pattern)

HOW THEY TYPICALLY RESPOND TO YOUR PATTERN:
(Their reaction to your reaction)

WHERE THIS USUALLY ENDS UP:
(The typical outcome of this cycle)

THE DANCE:
Write out the cycle as a repeating pattern. What triggers what triggers what?"
  placeholder="Our pattern..."
  rows={14}
/>

</Exercise>

## The High-Definition Map

Now compile everything into a single comprehensive map.

<Exercise title="Complete Pattern Map">

<Journal
  id="complete-pattern-map"
  prompt="MY RELATIONSHIP PATTERN - HIGH DEFINITION

ATTACHMENT TENDENCY:
(Secure/Anxious/Avoidant/Disorganized — and specifically how it manifests in you)

ORIGIN:
(Where this pattern came from, what it was adapting to)

SPECIFIC TRIGGERS:
(The 3-5 things that most reliably activate you)

BODY SIGNATURE:
(How activation feels in your body — first signs)

THOUGHT PATTERN:
(The interpretive lens, the story you tell yourself)

URGE PATTERN:
(What you want to do when activated)

BEHAVIORAL PATTERN:
(What you actually do — the visible manifestation)

AVOIDANCE PATTERN:
(What you steer away from, don't say, don't do)

COST:
(What this pattern costs you in relationships)

FUNCTION:
(What this pattern protects you from — its purpose)"
  placeholder="My complete pattern map..."
  rows={30}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Crucial Insight

Here's what matters about your pattern:

**It's not a problem to fix. It's a strategy that no longer fits.**

This pattern was intelligent. It served you. In your original environment, it was the best adaptation available.

But you're not in that environment anymore. And the strategy that protected you then is now limiting you.

The goal isn't to eliminate the pattern — you can't just delete neural pathways. The goal is to:

1. Recognize it when it's operating
2. Create space between trigger and response
3. Have more options available
4. Choose consciously rather than react automatically

That's what the rest of this course builds.

## This Week's Practice: Catching It Live

Now that you have your pattern mapped, practice catching it in real-time.

<Exercise title="Week 2 Practice: Live Pattern Recognition">

### Instructions:

This week, your practice is catching your pattern AS IT'S HAPPENING — not after, not in reflection, but in the moment.

Each time you notice yourself in your pattern:

1. Name it internally: "This is my pattern"
2. Notice the body sensations
3. Don't try to change anything — just observe

**The goal is recognition, not intervention.** You're building the muscle of seeing the pattern while it's running. This is harder than it sounds.

### Log Template:

<Journal
  id="live-recognition-log"
  prompt="LIVE RECOGNITION LOG

Record each time you caught your pattern while it was happening:

DATE/TIME:
SITUATION:
WHAT TRIGGERED IT:
BODY SENSATION I NOTICED:
HOW FAR INTO THE PATTERN WAS I WHEN I NOTICED?
(Scale: 1 = noticed immediately, 10 = noticed after fully acted out)

WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I NOTICED:"
  placeholder="Log your live pattern recognition..."
  rows={14}
/>

### End of Week Reflection:

<Journal
  id="week2-reflection"
  prompt="After a week of practice:

How many times did you catch your pattern live?

How quickly are you catching it? Earlier in the sequence or later?

What are you learning about the gap between trigger and behavior?"
  placeholder="Week 2 reflection..."
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Requirements to Continue

You have completed this module when:

1. You've completed the Pattern Mapping exercises
2. You've created your Complete Pattern Map
3. You've practiced live pattern recognition for at least 5 days
4. You've logged at least 3 instances of catching your pattern in real-time
5. You've completed the end-of-week reflection

**Save your Complete Pattern Map.** You'll refer back to it throughout the course and use it in your final assessment.

## What's Next

In Module 3, we move from recognizing the pattern to working with its physical foundation — the nervous system dynamics that make the pattern run.

You know your pattern now. Next, you learn to work with the body that runs it.

---

*Knowing your pattern isn't the same as changing it. But you can't change what you can't see. The high-definition map is your first tool — the ability to recognize exactly what you do, when you do it, and what it costs. Now you can see it. Now you can work with it.*
