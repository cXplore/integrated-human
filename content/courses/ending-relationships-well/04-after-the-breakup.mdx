## The First Days and Weeks

The conversation is over. Now what?

The immediate aftermath of a breakup is disorienting. Even when you're the one who ended things, there's grief, doubt, and a strange emptiness where the relationship used to be.

This module covers practical and emotional navigation of the first phase.

---

## The Immediate Aftermath

### What's Normal

In the first days and weeks:
- Shock (even if you expected it)
- Relief (even if you're sad)
- Doubt ("Did I make the right choice?")
- Grief (for what was and what won't be)
- Disorientation (routines disrupted)
- Waves of emotion (up and down)

All of this is normal.

### Physical Effects

Breakups affect the body:
- Sleep disruption
- Appetite changes
- Low energy or restlessness
- Physical aches
- Immune system effects

Take care of basics: sleep, eat, move.

### The Urge to Reach Out

You may want to:
- Check on them
- Apologize or explain more
- Take it back
- Just hear their voice

These urges are normal. They pass.

## Contact After the Breakup

### The Case for No Contact

Limited contact helps:
- Both people begin to heal
- New patterns form
- The bond loosens naturally
- Clarity emerges
- Forward movement becomes possible

Staying in contact keeps the wound open.

### What No Contact Means

Typically:
- No texting or calling
- No social media checking/following
- No showing up at their places
- No asking mutual friends about them
- No "just checking in"

Exceptions for practical matters only.

### How Long?

There's no perfect timeline:
- Minimum: several weeks to months
- Longer relationships may need longer
- Until you feel genuinely okay without contact
- Until contact wouldn't destabilize you

It's longer than you think.

<Exercise title="Setting Your Contact Boundaries">

Create your contact plan.

### Part 1: Contact Assessment

<Journal
  id="atb-contact"
  prompt="Assess your contact patterns and urges:

• What's your urge to contact them?
• What do you hope contact would give you?
• How has past contact (if any) affected you?
• What would be helpful vs. harmful?
• What do you need to protect yourself?"
  placeholder="Urge to contact:

What I hope for:

Past contact effects:

Helpful vs. harmful:

What I need to protect:..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 2: Contact Boundaries

<Journal
  id="atb-bounds"
  prompt="Set specific boundaries:

• Will you have no contact or limited contact?
• What practical exceptions exist (shared logistics)?
• How will you handle social media?
• How will you handle mutual friends?
• What will you do when you want to break these boundaries?"
  placeholder="No contact or limited:

  rows={14}

</Exercise>

## Practical Logistics

### If You Lived Together

Immediate concerns:
- Who stays, who goes?
- How quickly?
- Shared possessions?
- Lease and financial obligations?
- Minimizing extended contact during transition?

Create a plan, stick to it, don't prolong.

### Shared Finances

Address:
- Joint accounts
- Shared bills
- Money owed
- Dividing assets

Handle business-like matters business-like.

### Shared Social World

Navigate:
- Mutual friends (they don't have to choose)
- Shared activities or groups
- Running into each other
- What to tell people

You may need to make some temporary changes to your routines.

### Belongings Exchange

Keep it simple:
- One exchange, if possible
- Box up their stuff, have a friend deliver
- Don't use exchanges as opportunities to talk
- Get closure through the exchange, not through conversation

---

## Second-Guessing

### Doubt Is Normal

After breaking up, expect:
- "Did I make a mistake?"
- Remembering the good times
- Wondering if you tried hard enough
- Fantasizing about reconciliation

This is normal, especially in the early days.

### Why Doubt Happens

Doubt comes from:
- Grief (missing what you had)
- Discomfort of change
- Romanticizing the past
- Fear of being alone
- Withdrawal from attachment

Doubt isn't evidence you were wrong.

### Navigating Doubt

When doubt comes:
- Remember why you decided to leave
- Review your journal entries from before
- Talk to your support person
- Give it time
- Don't act on doubt in the first weeks

Decisions made in grief are often regretted.

<Exercise title="Handling Doubt">

Prepare for second-guessing.

### Part 1: Your Reasons

<Journal
  id="atb-reasons"
  prompt="Write down your reasons for leaving (reference later when doubting):

• What wasn't working?
• What made you unhappy?
• What did you try that didn't work?
• What did you know that won't change?
• Why was this the right decision?"
  placeholder="What wasn't working:

What made me unhappy:

What I tried:

What won't change:

Why it was right:..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 2: When Doubt Comes

<Journal
  id="atb-doubt"
  prompt="Plan for when doubt hits:

• What will you tell yourself?
• Who will you call?
• What will you NOT do? (e.g., reach out)
• How long will you wait before reconsidering?
• What would you need to see to genuinely reconsider?"
  placeholder="What I'll tell myself:

Who I'll call:

What I will NOT do:

## Support Systems

### Who Can Help

Reach out to:
- Close friends who support you
- Family members who understand
- Therapist or counselor
- Support groups

You shouldn't do this alone.

### What You Need from Support

Different people for different needs:
- Someone to distract you
- Someone to listen to you process
- Someone to remind you why you left
- Someone to do practical tasks with you

### What to Avoid

Be careful of:
- People who tell you what to feel
- Those who badmouth your ex excessively
- Anyone pushing you to "move on" too fast
- Those who make it about themselves

---

## Taking Care of Yourself

### Basic Maintenance

In the first weeks:
- Maintain sleep schedule (even when hard)
- Eat regular meals (even without appetite)
- Move your body (even short walks)
- Limit alcohol and substances
- Keep some structure

Basics keep you afloat.

### What Helps

Activities that support:
- Being with supportive people
- Physical activity
- Creative expression
- Time in nature
- Journaling and processing
- Routine and structure

### What Doesn't Help

Activities that make it worse:
- Isolation
- Numbing with substances
- Ruminating constantly
- Checking their social media
- Rebound relationships (too soon)
- Major life decisions

<Callout type="important">
The first days and weeks are the hardest. The urge to reach out, to take it back, to get relief from the discomfort—it's strong. Ride it out. The intensity will decrease. Give yourself time before doing anything that can't be undone.
</Callout>

*The hardest part isn't the conversation. It's the days after. Hang on.*
