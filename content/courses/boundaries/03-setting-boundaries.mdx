## The Boundary Setting Process

Setting boundaries involves three steps:

1. **Know your limit** — What's actually okay and not okay with you?
2. **Communicate clearly** — Express the boundary directly
3. **Maintain consistently** — Hold the boundary over time

This module focuses on the first two. The next module addresses maintenance.

## Step 1: Know Your Limit

Before you can set a boundary, you need to know where it is.

### Signals That a Boundary Is Needed

**Body signals:**
- Tension, tightness
- Feeling drained after interactions
- Physical pulling-away sensation
- Stomach clenching
- Jaw tightening

**Emotional signals:**
- Resentment building
- Feeling used or taken advantage of
- Dreading interactions
- Anger after saying yes
- Guilt as manipulation pressure

**Behavioral signals:**
- Avoiding the person/situation
- Passive-aggressive responses
- Saying yes and then not following through
- Complaining to others instead of addressing directly

**The question to ask:** "What do I need here that I'm not honoring?"

### Clarifying the Specific Limit

Get specific about what's actually not okay:

**Vague:** "I need more respect"
**Specific:** "I need you to stop interrupting me when I'm talking"

**Vague:** "I need space"
**Specific:** "I need Sunday mornings to myself"

**Vague:** "This is too much"
**Specific:** "I can help for two hours, not the whole weekend"

**The formula:** What specifically is happening + what specifically you need instead

### Boundary Clarity Exercise

Think of a boundary you need to set:

**The situation/relationship:**

**What's happening that's not okay:**

**What I actually need:**

**The specific boundary:**

## Step 2: Communicate the Boundary

### The Basics of Boundary Language

**Be direct.** Don't hint, imply, or hope they'll figure it out.

**Be clear.** State specifically what you need, not vaguely.

**Be calm.** Boundaries communicated in anger often get dismissed as "you're overreacting."

**Be brief.** You don't need to justify extensively. Over-explanation invites negotiation.

### The Basic Boundary Formula

**"I need/want/prefer [your limit] because [brief reason if helpful]."**

Or even simpler:

**"I'm not able to [thing they want]."**
**"That doesn't work for me."**
**"I'm not available for that."**

### You Don't Owe an Explanation

You can give a reason if you want, but you don't have to. "No" is a complete sentence.

**With explanation:** "I can't watch your kids Saturday because I have plans."
**Without:** "I'm not available Saturday." or just "I can't do Saturday."

Both are valid. Over-explaining often:
- Opens door to negotiation/convincing
- Suggests you need permission
- Invites them to invalidate your reason

### Boundary Scripts

**For requests you can't fulfill:**
- "I'm not able to do that."
- "That won't work for me."
- "I'll have to say no to this one."
- "I'm not the right person for this."
- "I can't commit to that right now."

**For behavior that's not okay:**
- "I need you to stop [specific behavior]."
- "That's not okay with me."
- "I'm not willing to continue if [behavior continues]."
- "Please don't [specific behavior]."

**For recurring issues:**
- "We've talked about this before. I need [specific limit]."
- "This is something I won't budge on."
- "I've made my position clear."

**For invasive questions:**
- "I'd rather not discuss that."
- "That's not something I share."
- "I'm going to keep that private."

**For ending conversations:**
- "I'm done discussing this."
- "I've said what I need to say."
- "This conversation is over for now."

## The "I" Statement Approach

When addressing behavior, "I" statements are less likely to trigger defensiveness:

**Instead of:** "You're always interrupting me"
**Try:** "I feel frustrated when I get interrupted. I need to finish my thoughts."

**Instead of:** "You don't care about my time"
**Try:** "I feel disrespected when plans change last minute. I need more notice."

**The formula:**
"I feel [emotion] when [specific behavior]. I need [what you need]."

### When to Use "I" Statements vs. Direct Statements

**"I" statements** work well when:
- The relationship matters and you want connection
- You're addressing impact rather than character
- De-escalation is important

**Direct statements** work well when:
- You've tried softer approaches
- The boundary is non-negotiable
- You're dealing with someone who doesn't respond to softer language
- Safety is a concern

## Common Boundary Situations

### Work Boundaries

**After-hours contact:**
"I don't check email after 6pm. I'll respond tomorrow."
"I keep my evenings for personal time. We can discuss this tomorrow."

**Overwork:**
"I can take on this project, but something else will need to come off my plate."
"That's not realistic in this timeframe. I can do X by [date] or Y by [date]."

**Inappropriate requests:**
"That's outside my role. You'll need to speak with [appropriate person]."
"I'm not comfortable doing that."

### Family Boundaries

**Intrusive questions:**
"I'd prefer not to discuss my relationship status."
"That's between me and [partner]."

**Unsolicited advice:**
"I appreciate you care, but I'm not looking for advice on this."
"I've got this handled."

**Visits and contact:**
"I can visit for the day, not the weekend."
"I'm available for a weekly call, not daily."

**Parenting from parents:**
"I've got my own approach to parenting."
"I need you to respect how I'm raising my kids."

### Friend Boundaries

**One-sided relationships:**
"I've noticed I'm usually the one reaching out. I need more reciprocity."
"I love supporting you, but I need to vent sometimes too."

**Chronic lateness:**
"I need you to be on time. If you're more than 15 minutes late, I'll leave."
"I value my time. Can we commit to being punctual?"

**Emotional dumping:**
"I care about you, but I can't be your only support for this."
"I have capacity for about 20 minutes on this tonight."

### Intimate Relationship Boundaries

**Space needs:**
"I need some alone time tonight to recharge."
"I'm not ready to talk about this yet. I need some time to process."

**Communication:**
"I won't continue this conversation if there's yelling."
"Let's take a break and come back when we're both calm."

**Physical:**
"I'm not in the mood tonight."
"I like [this], I don't like [that]."

## Tone and Delivery

### Calm and Matter-of-Fact

The most effective boundaries are stated calmly, without excessive emotion or apology.

**Over-apologetic:** "I'm so sorry, I feel terrible, but maybe, if it's okay, could you possibly not do that? I'm probably being ridiculous..."

**Aggressive:** "I've had it! You ALWAYS do this! Stop it!"

**Calm and clear:** "I need you to stop doing that. It's not okay with me."

### Firm Doesn't Mean Harsh

You can be firm without being cruel:

**Harsh:** "That's none of your business. Back off."
**Firm and kind:** "That's something I keep private. I appreciate your understanding."

**Harsh:** "I'm not your therapist."
**Firm and kind:** "I care about you, but I don't have capacity to be your main support for this."

### The Broken Record Technique

When someone pushes back, repeat your boundary calmly without escalating:

**Them:** "But I really need you to..."
**You:** "I understand, and I'm not able to."
**Them:** "But just this once..."
**You:** "I'm not available for that."
**Them:** "You're being unreasonable."
**You:** "You might feel that way, and my answer is still no."

Same message, different words, no JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain).

---

## What Not to Do

### Don't JADE (Too Much)

**J**ustify — Give endless reasons
**A**rgue — Debate whether your boundary is valid
**D**efend — Explain why you deserve this boundary
**E**xplain — Over-elaborate

A brief reason is fine. Extensive JADE-ing invites negotiation and suggests your boundary needs approval.

### Don't Apologize for Having Needs

**Over-apologetic:** "I'm so sorry, I know this is inconvenient, I feel bad asking..."
**Appropriate:** "I need X."

Your needs don't require apology.

### Don't Wait Until You're Furious

Boundaries set in anger often come out harsh or are dismissed. Address issues before they build to explosion.

### Don't Make It About Their Character

**Character attack:** "You're so selfish and inconsiderate."
**Behavior focus:** "When you do X, I feel Y. I need Z."

### Don't Expect Mind-Reading

People can't respect boundaries they don't know about. Clear communication is necessary.

## Exercise: Boundary Script Development

### Part 1: Identify Three Boundaries You Need

**Boundary 1:**
- Situation:
- What I need:
- Script:

**Boundary 2:**
- Situation:
- What I need:
- Script:

**Boundary 3:**
- Situation:
- What I need:
- Script:

### Part 2: Anticipate Pushback

For each boundary, what might they say?

**Boundary 1 pushback:**
**My response:**

**Boundary 2 pushback:**
**My response:**

**Boundary 3 pushback:**
**My response:**

### Part 3: Practice

Say your boundary scripts out loud. Notice:
- What feels hard to say?
- Where do you want to over-explain?
- What's your body doing?

---

## Starting Small

If boundary-setting is new, start with:

1. **Lower-stakes situations** — Practice with strangers, acquaintances, or small matters before tackling big relationships.

2. **Boundaries most likely to be respected** — Build confidence with receptive people first.

3. **Clear violations** — Start where the boundary need is obvious, not ambiguous.

4. **Support** — Have someone who supports your boundary-setting to debrief with.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Know Your Limit:** Identify the specific boundary needed through body signals, emotions, and behavioral cues.

- **Communicate Clearly:** Direct, calm, brief statements work best. Avoid over-explaining.

- **"I" Statements:** "I feel [X] when [behavior]. I need [Y]." Reduces defensiveness.

- **No JADE-ing:** Don't excessively Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain. Your boundary is valid.

- **Broken Record:** Calmly repeat your boundary without escalating when there's pushback.

## What's Next

Module 4 addresses the hardest part—maintaining boundaries when others push back, guilt-trip, or violate your limits. Setting the boundary is step one; holding it is the ongoing work.

Practice your scripts. Say them out loud. The more you rehearse, the more available the words are when you need them.

*A boundary isn't an attack. It's information about how to be in relationship with you.*
