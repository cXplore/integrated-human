## The Patterns That Run Your Life

By now, you may be noticing connections:
- Your nervous system patterns (Week 2)
- Your shadow material (Week 3)
- Your emotional patterns (Week 4)

These connect into larger patterns—recurring themes that shape your life.

**Patterns are the automatic programs running in the background.** They're not random—they made sense when they formed. But they may no longer serve you.

---

## What Are Patterns?

Patterns are stable configurations of:
- **Beliefs** — What you assume is true
- **Emotions** — What you habitually feel
- **Body** — How you physically hold yourself
- **Behavior** — What you do repeatedly
- **Results** — What keeps happening in your life

These reinforce each other in loops:

```
Belief → Emotion → Body response → Behavior → Result → Confirms belief
```

**Example:**
- Belief: "I'm not good enough"
- Emotion: Anxiety, shame
- Body: Contracted, tense
- Behavior: Overwork, people-please, avoid visibility
- Result: Exhaustion, relationships where you're not valued
- Confirms belief: "See? I'm not good enough"

---

## Pattern Categories

### Self-Worth Patterns
Beliefs and behaviors around deserving:
- "I'm not enough"
- "I have to earn love/rest/success"
- "If they really knew me..."
- Overworking, underselling, settling

### Control Patterns
How you manage uncertainty:
- Controlling others or outcomes
- Rigid planning/structure
- Inability to delegate
- Anxiety when not in control

### Avoidance Patterns
How you escape discomfort:
- Procrastination
- Numbing (substances, screens, food)
- Staying busy to avoid feeling
- Avoiding difficult conversations

### Relational Patterns
How you connect (or don't):
- Attachment style patterns (anxious, avoidant)
- Caretaking/rescuing
- Isolation
- Power dynamics (one-up, one-down)

### Achievement Patterns
How you relate to success:
- Perfectionism
- Fear of failure (or success)
- External validation dependence
- Never enough accomplishment

## The Anatomy of a Pattern

### 1. Origin Event(s)
Something happened that created the pattern. Often in childhood, sometimes later trauma.

### 2. Adaptive Function
The pattern protected you or helped you survive. It was intelligent given the circumstances.

### 3. Core Belief
A conclusion about self, others, or the world. "I am...", "People are...", "Life is..."

### 4. Emotional Set-Point
The emotions the pattern generates: anxiety, shame, anger, depression.

### 5. Body Holding
How the pattern lives in your body: posture, tension, breath.

### 6. Behavioral Expression
What you DO because of the pattern.

### 7. Results/Consequences
What keeps happening in your life.

### 8. Reinforcement
How results confirm the core belief, keeping the pattern going.

## Exercise: Pattern Mapping

### Part 1: Identify Your Patterns

**Life Area Scan:**

What keeps happening in your:

**Work/Career:**
- What patterns repeat?
- What beliefs drive them?
- What emotions accompany them?

**Relationships:**
- What patterns repeat?
- What beliefs drive them?
- What emotions accompany them?

**Self/Health:**
- What patterns repeat?
- What beliefs drive them?
- What emotions accompany them?

**Money/Resources:**
- What patterns repeat?
- What beliefs drive them?
- What emotions accompany them?

### Part 2: Deep Dive One Pattern

Choose the pattern that costs you most.

**Name the pattern:**
(Give it a simple name you can reference)

**Describe what happens:**
(The recurring sequence—what triggers it, what you do, what results)

**The core belief:**
(Complete: "I am...", "Others are...", "Life is...")

**The emotional flavor:**
(What emotions accompany this pattern?)

**How it lives in your body:**
(Posture, tension, sensation)

**Origin:**
(Where did this come from? What was happening when it formed?)

**Adaptive function:**
(What did this protect you from or help you get?)

**Current cost:**
(What is this pattern costing you now?)

---

## Transforming Patterns

### Step 1: See It
You can't change what you can't see. Awareness is the first intervention.

Name the pattern. Watch it in action. Notice the full sequence without trying to stop it.

### Step 2: Understand It
Where did it come from? What was it protecting? This creates compassion rather than self-judgment.

### Step 3: Interrupt It
The pattern runs automatically. Any interruption creates space for choice.

Interrupt at any point:
- **Thought level:** Notice and question the belief
- **Emotional level:** Feel without acting
- **Body level:** Change posture, breathe, move
- **Behavioral level:** Do something different

### Step 4: Create Alternative
What's the new belief? New behavior? New way of being?

Not the opposite extreme—that's another trap. Find the middle path.

### Step 5: Practice Relentlessly
New patterns require repetition. The old pattern has years of practice. The new one needs reps.

### Step 6: Integrate Setbacks
You will fall into old patterns. This isn't failure—it's data. Learn and continue.

## Working with Core Beliefs

Core beliefs are the foundation of patterns. Common ones:

**About self:**
- I'm not enough
- I'm too much
- I'm broken/damaged
- I don't deserve
- I can't trust myself

**About others:**
- People will leave
- People can't be trusted
- People will hurt me
- No one understands
- I have to earn love

**About life:**
- Life is hard
- Good things don't last
- Something bad will happen
- I can't have what I want
- It's not safe

### Questioning Beliefs

For any core belief, ask:

1. Is this actually true? (Evidence for and against)
2. Where did I learn this?
3. Does believing this serve me?
4. What would I believe if I could choose?
5. What would life be like with a different belief?

### Creating New Beliefs

New beliefs should be:
- **Believable** — Not so positive they feel false
- **Embodied** — Not just mental, but felt
- **Practiced** — Repeated until grooved

**Example progression:**
- Old: "I'm not enough"
- Bridge: "I'm learning that I might be enough"
- New: "I am enough as I am"

## Daily Practices: Week 5

### Morning (10 min)

1. **Pattern awareness intention** (2 min)
   - What pattern am I watching for today?
   - Where is it likely to show up?

2. **New belief practice** (5 min)
   - State your new/bridge belief
   - Feel it in your body
   - Notice resistance without fighting it

3. **Regulation** (3 min)
   - Ground for the day ahead

### Throughout Day

**Pattern catching**
When you notice a pattern running:
- Name it: "There's the [pattern name]"
- Pause before automatic response
- Choose: follow pattern or try something different?
- Note what you did for evening review

**Belief questioning**
When you notice a core belief:
- "Is this actually true right now?"
- "What would someone without this belief see?"

### Evening (10 min)

1. **Pattern review** (5 min)
   - Where did patterns show up today?
   - What did I notice?
   - Where did I interrupt successfully?
   - Where did I follow the old pattern?

2. **Celebration and compassion** (2 min)
   - Celebrate any interruptions
   - Compassion for times you fell into pattern

3. **Tomorrow intention** (3 min)
   - What situation tomorrow might trigger patterns?
   - What's my plan?

---

## Patterns and the Other Pillars

### Patterns and Body
Patterns live in the body. Changing posture can interrupt patterns. Body awareness catches patterns earlier.

### Patterns and Shadow
Many patterns are driven by shadow material. Integrating shadow often resolves the pattern.

### Patterns and Emotions
Emotional patterns are part of larger patterns. Emotional capacity allows sitting with pattern discomfort.

### Patterns and Relationships
Relationship patterns are where we often see our patterns most clearly. Others mirror us.

---

## The Long Game

Patterns don't transform overnight. They took years to develop and will take time to change.

**What to expect:**
- Awareness increases immediately
- Interruptions become possible with practice
- New responses feel awkward at first
- Old patterns show up less frequently
- Eventually, new patterns become automatic

**Be patient.** This is the work of a lifetime. Progress, not perfection.

---

## Reflection Questions: Week 5

1. What pattern has cost you the most in life?

2. If you could change one core belief, which would it be?

3. What would your life be like without your most limiting pattern?

4. What is your pattern trying to protect you from? Is that threat still real?

5. Who would you be if you were free of your patterns?

---

## Key Concepts

- **Pattern:** A stable configuration of beliefs, emotions, body states, and behaviors that repeats

- **Core Belief:** The foundational assumption about self, others, or life that drives patterns

- **Pattern Interruption:** Any break in the automatic sequence that creates space for choice

- **Bridge Belief:** A transitional belief between an old limiting belief and a new empowering one

---

## What's Next

Week 6 brings it to Relationships—where patterns become most visible and most challenging. You'll work with attachment patterns, communication, and how to relate more consciously.

Continue your pattern work this week. Remember: just seeing the pattern is already changing it.

*Your patterns are not who you are. They're strategies you developed. And strategies can be updated.*
