## Your Unique Patterns

Everyone has a unique emotional landscape—characteristic patterns of what you feel, how intensely, what triggers you, and how you respond. Before developing new skills, you need to map your territory.

---

## Your Emotional Range

### The Range of Feelings

Humans can feel:
- Joy, happiness, contentment, delight, ecstasy
- Sadness, grief, melancholy, despair
- Fear, anxiety, terror, worry, dread
- Anger, frustration, rage, annoyance, resentment
- Disgust, contempt, revulsion
- Shame, guilt, embarrassment
- Surprise, wonder, awe
- Love, affection, tenderness, compassion
- And many more

### Your Personal Range

Your range may be:
- Full access to all emotions
- Limited (some emotions not felt)
- Skewed (some felt too much)
- Narrow (only a few emotions)
