## The Relational Dimension

Emotions don't exist in isolation—they arise in and shape our relationships. This module explores how to navigate emotions in connection with others.

---

## Emotions Create Relationships

### The Emotional Basis

Relationships are emotional:
- We connect through feeling
- Emotions are what we share
- Intimacy is emotional knowing
- Disconnection is often emotional

### Emotional Attunement

Attunement is:
- Sensing others' emotional states
- Responding appropriately
- Creating felt connection
- The foundation of intimacy

### Emotional Absence

Without emotional presence:
- Relationships feel empty
- Connection is superficial
- Needs go unmet
- People feel lonely

Your emotional patterns affect:
- Who you attract
- How you connect
- What triggers you
- How conflicts go
- The depth of intimacy possible

### Patterns to Know

Be aware of:
- What emotions you bring to relationships
- What emotions others trigger in you

## Empathy and Attunement

### What Empathy Is

Empathy is:
- Sensing what another feels
- Imagining their inner world
- Responding with care
- Not the same as agreeing

### Developing Empathy

To develop empathy:
- Listen without preparing your response
- Imagine their perspective
- Ask about their experience
- Reflect what you sense
- Validate their feelings

### Attunement in Practice

Attunement looks like:
- "You seem upset—is that right?"
- "I notice you went quiet"
- "That sounds really hard"
- Matching your energy to theirs appropriately

## Emotional Contagion

### Feelings Are Contagious

Emotions spread:
- We pick up others' feelings
- Others pick up ours
- This happens unconsciously
- Can be helpful or harmful

### Managing Contagion

To manage:
- Notice when you've "caught" an emotion
- Ask: "Is this mine or theirs?"
- Ground yourself
- Don't take on what isn't yours
- Be aware of what you're transmitting

## Co-Regulation

### What It Is

Co-regulation is:
- Regulating together
- Calm presence calms others
- Activated presence activates others
- We regulate each other

### Being Regulated for Others

Your regulation matters:
- Your calm can calm them
- Your regulation offers safety
- Be a regulated presence
- This is relationship skill

### Seeking Co-Regulation

You can seek regulation:
- Presence of calm person helps
- Ask for what you need
- Let others regulate you
- This is not weakness

What matters is repair:

### Emotional Boundaries

Boundaries include:

Boundaries sound like:
