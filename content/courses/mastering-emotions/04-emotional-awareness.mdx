## Knowing What You Feel

Emotional awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence. You can't regulate what you don't know you're feeling. You can't express what you can't identify. This module develops your capacity to know what you feel.

---

## What Emotional Awareness Is

### Definition

Emotional awareness is:
- Recognizing when you're having an emotional experience
- Identifying which emotion it is
- Understanding the intensity
- Knowing what triggered it
- Being able to describe it

### Levels of Awareness

Awareness develops in levels:
1. Noticing something is happening (body sensation)
2. Recognizing it as emotional
3. Identifying the emotion
4. Understanding the cause
5. Seeing patterns

### Why It Matters

Without awareness:
- Emotions drive you unconsciously
- You react without choosing
- Relationships suffer
- Regulation is impossible

• How aware are you of your emotions, generally?
  (1-10)
• Can you usually identify what you're feeling?
• Do you notice emotions in your body?
• Do you know your emotional triggers?

## Barriers to Awareness

### Why We Don't Know What We Feel

Barriers include:
- **Numbing:** Emotions have been suppressed
- **Speed:** Life moves too fast to notice
- **Distraction:** Always occupied with something
- **Fear:** What if I feel something overwhelming?
- **Training:** Never learned to notice
- **Alexithymia:** Difficulty identifying emotions

### Your Barriers

You may have:
- Some barriers more than others
- Barriers for specific emotions
- Historical reasons for disconnection
- Capacity that can be developed

---

<Exercise title="Your Awareness Barriers">

Identify what blocks your emotional awareness.

<Journal
  id="ea-barriers"
  prompt="Explore what blocks your awareness:

• What makes it hard to know what you feel?
• Which specific barriers apply to you?
• Are there certain emotions you're especially unaware of?
• What's the history of your disconnection?
• What would help you develop awareness?"

## Developing Awareness

### The Basic Practice

The fundamental practice:
1. Pause
2. Turn attention inward
3. Notice what's happening in your body
4. Ask: "What am I feeling?"
5. Try to name it
6. Notice more

### Regular Check-Ins

Build awareness through:
- Scheduled emotional check-ins
- Multiple times per day
- Brief but consistent
- "What am I feeling right now?"

### Body-Based Awareness

Start with the body:
- What sensations are present?
- Where is there tension or ease?
- What's the quality of breath?
- What does this body state suggest about emotion?

---

<Exercise title="Awareness Practice">

Practice emotional awareness right now.

<Journal
  id="ea-practice"
  prompt="Practice awareness now:

Pause. Take a few breaths. Turn attention inward.

• What sensations do you notice in your body?
• What emotions might be present?
• Name what you're feeling.
• What intensity is it (1-10)?
• What triggered this emotional state?
• What do you notice about this practice?"

## Emotional Vocabulary

### Why Words Matter

Naming emotions:
- Makes them more manageable
- Activates regulation circuitry
- Allows communication
- Creates understanding

### Beyond Basic Words

Basic words (happy, sad, angry, scared) are a start, but nuance matters:
- Instead of "bad": anxious, frustrated, disappointed, ashamed, lonely
- Instead of "good": content, excited, peaceful, grateful, proud
- Specific words give specific understanding

### Building Vocabulary

Expand your vocabulary through:
- Learning emotion words
- Practicing precise labeling
- Using feeling words lists
- Getting specific

---

<Exercise title="Emotional Vocabulary">

Expand your emotional vocabulary.

<Journal
  id="ea-vocab"
  prompt="Develop your emotional vocabulary:

List as many emotion words as you can for each category:

HAPPY family (variations of good feelings):

SAD family (variations of sadness):

ANGRY family (variations of anger):

SCARED family (variations of fear):

SHAME family:

OTHER emotions:

Which categories have more words? Fewer?"

## Distinguishing Emotions

### Similar Emotions

Some emotions feel similar but are different:
- Fear vs. excitement (both activate)
- Sadness vs. depression
- Anger vs. frustration vs. irritation
- Guilt vs. shame
- Anxiety vs. fear

### How to Distinguish

Distinguish by:
- The trigger (what caused it)
- The action tendency (what you want to do)
- The underlying need
- The exact quality

### Why It Matters

Precision matters because:
- Different emotions need different responses
- Misidentification leads to wrong action
- Understanding requires accuracy

---

<Exercise title="Distinguishing Practice">

Practice distinguishing similar emotions.

<Journal
  id="ea-distinguish"
  prompt="Practice distinguishing emotions:

For each pair, describe how they're different for you:

Fear vs. Excitement:
How do they feel different? What's the trigger difference?

Sadness vs. Disappointment:
How are they different?

Anger vs. Frustration:
How are they different?

Guilt vs. Shame:
How are they different?

What helps you distinguish similar emotions?"

## Awareness in the Moment

### Real-Time Awareness

The goal is awareness as emotions arise:
- Not just retrospective
- In the moment
- Before acting
- With enough space to choose

### The Pause

Creating space:
- Notice the trigger
- Pause before reacting
- Name what you feel
- Then choose response

### Practice Points

Practice awareness:
- When triggered
- During strong emotions
- In relationships
- Multiple times daily

---

## Tracking Over Time

### Patterns Emerge

Tracking emotions reveals:
- Recurring triggers
- Time patterns (morning, night)
- Context patterns
- Growth over time

### Emotion Tracking

Ways to track:
- Journaling
- Apps
- Scheduled check-ins
- End-of-day review

### What to Track

Track:
- What emotion
- Intensity
- Trigger
- Response
- What helped

---

<Exercise title="Emotion Tracking Plan">

Create a plan for ongoing tracking.

<Journal
  id="ea-track"
  prompt="Plan your emotion tracking:

• How will you track emotions?
  (Journal, app, check-ins)
• How often will you check in?
• What will you track?
• When will you review patterns?
• What's your commitment to tracking this week?"

## Key Concepts

- **Emotional awareness:** Recognizing and identifying what you feel
- **Barriers:** What blocks awareness (numbing, speed, fear)
- **Basic practice:** Pause, turn inward, notice body, name emotion
- **Vocabulary:** Precise words enable understanding
- **Distinguishing:** Similar emotions need careful differentiation
- **Real-time:** The goal is awareness in the moment
- **Tracking:** Patterns emerge through consistent tracking

<Callout type="important">
Emotional awareness is a skill that develops with practice. Like any skill, it may feel awkward at first. Keep practicing. Regular check-ins are more valuable than occasional deep dives. Build the habit, and awareness will grow.
