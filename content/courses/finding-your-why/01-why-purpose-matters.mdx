## The Question That Won't Go Away

"What am I here for?" "What's the point?" "Is this all there is?"

These questions find us all eventually. Something inside us seeks meaning—not just survival, not just success, but significance. This mini-course introduces you to the quest for purpose and gives you tools to begin finding your why.

## Life Without Purpose

### The Experience

Without purpose, life can feel:
- Empty despite success
- Like going through motions
- Aimless
- Unfulfilling
- Meaningless

### Common Substitutes

People often substitute:
- Achievement (more accomplishments)
- Pleasure (more enjoyment)
- Accumulation (more stuff)
- Busyness (more activity)
- Others' expectations (more approval)

These help temporarily but don't satisfy the deeper need.
