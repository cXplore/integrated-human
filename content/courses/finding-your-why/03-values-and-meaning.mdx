## The Foundation of Purpose

Purpose without values is direction without meaning. Your core values—what matters most to you—are the foundation of any meaningful purpose. This module helps you identify your values and connect them to your sense of purpose.

---

## What Values Are

### Definition

Values are:
- What matters most to you
- What you care about deeply
- What you won't compromise
- What guides your choices
- What makes life feel meaningful

### Values vs. Goals

**Goals:** Things you want to achieve
**Values:** How you want to live while achieving them

Goals are destinations; values are directions.

### Why Values Matter for Purpose

Purpose aligned with values:
- Feels authentic and right
- Is sustainable long-term
- Provides deeper satisfaction
- Withstands difficulty

Purpose that violates values:
- Feels wrong even when successful
- Creates internal conflict
- Is hard to sustain
- Leaves you empty

## Identifying Your Values

### Values List

Consider which resonate:

**Achievement:** Excellence, success, mastery, growth
**Connection:** Love, family, friendship, belonging
**Integrity:** Honesty, authenticity, honor
**Freedom:** Autonomy, independence, adventure
**Service:** Helping, compassion, contribution
**Meaning:** Purpose, wisdom, truth, spirituality
**Creativity:** Expression, beauty, innovation
**Security:** Stability, safety, order
**Justice:** Fairness, equality, rights

### Your Top Values

You care about many things, but what's most essential?
- If you could only keep 5 values, which would they be?
- If you could only keep 3?
- If you could only keep 1?

## Living Your Values

<Callout type="important">
Your values are the foundation of meaningful purpose. Without them, purpose is just direction without depth. Know what matters most to you, live in greater alignment with those values, and let your purpose be an expression of what you care about. This is how purpose becomes not just a goal but a way of life.
</Callout>
