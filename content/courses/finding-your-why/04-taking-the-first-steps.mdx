## Purpose Isn't All-or-Nothing

### No Grand Revelation Required

Purpose often:
- Clarifies gradually
- Reveals itself through action
- Evolves over time
- Starts with hunches

### Waiting for Certainty

Don't wait for:
- 100% clarity
- Perfect understanding
- External validation
- The "right" moment

### Good Enough to Start

You need:
- A direction to explore
- Values to guide you
- Willingness to experiment
- Openness to learn

---

## Small Experiments

### Testing Purpose Hypotheses

Treat purpose as hypothesis:
- "I think my purpose might involve..."
- Test through small experiments
- See what fits
- Adjust based on experience

### Types of Experiments

Try:
- Volunteering in an area
- Taking a course
- Starting a small project
- Having conversations
- Shadowing someone
- Reading deeply in a field

### What Experiments Reveal

Experiments show:
- What energizes vs. drains
- What fits vs. doesn't
- What you thought vs. reality
- Where to explore further
