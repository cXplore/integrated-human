## Your Life Contains Clues

Purpose isn't invented from nothing—it's discovered in who you already are. Your history, your experiences, your natural inclinations all contain hints. This module helps you mine your life for clues about what you're here for.

- Natural orientation
- Authentic attraction
- What engaged you before conditioning
- Possible purpose directions

### What Adults Noticed

What did others see in you?

## Peak Experiences

### Moments of Aliveness

Throughout life, you've had peak moments:

### Looking for Patterns

Across multiple peak experiences:
- What's common?

## What Comes Naturally

### Your Natural Gifts

Some things come easier to you:
- What do you do without effort?

- What do people come to you for?

### Flow States

When does time disappear?
- What activities create flow?
- Where does effort feel effortless?
- What absorbs you completely?

### The Things You Take for Granted

Often we miss clues because:
- What's natural to us seems unremarkable
- We assume everyone can do what we can
- We discount our own gifts
- We're looking for something more dramatic
