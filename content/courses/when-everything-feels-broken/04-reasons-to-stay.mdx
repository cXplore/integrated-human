## When It's Hard to See the Point

When life has collapsed, it can be hard to see why you should keep going.

The pain is immense. The future is blank or terrifying. The effort of continuing seems pointless.

If you're feeling this way, you're not alone. And it doesn't make you broken or weak. It means you're carrying something very heavy, and that has real weight.

---

## A Direct Word

If you're having thoughts of ending your life, please know:

- These thoughts are more common than people admit
- Having them doesn't mean you'll act on them
- They're often a response to unbearable pain, not a genuine wish to die
- They usually mean: "I can't keep living *like this*"—not "I don't want to live"

**If you're in danger right now:**
- **988** (US Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) — Call or text
- **741741** (Crisis Text Line) — Text HOME
- Or tell someone nearby

You can call just to talk. You don't have to be in immediate danger to reach out.

---

<Callout type="important">
If you're in crisis, please reach out. You deserve support. The number again: 988 (US) or your local crisis line. These services exist specifically for moments like this.

## Reasons Don't Have to Be Grand

When we think of "reasons to live," we imagine big things:

- A grand purpose
- A life mission
- Deep fulfillment
- Future joy

But right now, you don't need grand. You need true. And true reasons can be small:

- A person who would miss you
- A pet who needs you
- A show you haven't finished
- A book you want to read
- A place you want to see
- A meal you enjoy
- Curiosity about what happens next

Small reasons are real reasons. They count.

---

## The People Reason

For many, the strongest thread is other people:

- Who would be devastated if you were gone?
- Who depends on you?
- Who would carry that grief forever?
- Who would you want to protect from that pain?

This isn't guilt. It's connection. You matter to people—even if you can't feel it right now. Their lives are different because you exist.

---

<Exercise title="People Who Would Miss You">

Who would be affected if you weren't here?

<Journal
  id="wefb-people"
  prompt="List the people who would miss you. Who would be affected?

Don't minimize this. Include:
• Family
• Friends (even distant ones)
• Pets
• Colleagues
• People you've helped
• Anyone whose life you touch"
  placeholder="People who would miss me:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5."
  rows={14}
/>

</Exercise>

---

## The Curiosity Reason

Another thread: what if you want to see what happens?

- How does this story end?
- What might life look like in 5 years?
- What unexpected things might happen?
- What might you be wrong about?

You don't have to believe life will be good. You just have to be curious enough to find out.

---

## The Spite Reason

Some people stay out of defiance:

- "I won't let this beat me"
- "I refuse to give up"
- "I'm going to survive this out of spite"

This isn't pretty motivation. But it's valid. Whatever keeps you here is good enough.

---

## The "Not Done" Reason

Maybe there's something you haven't finished:

- Something you want to create
- Someone you want to meet
- A place you want to go
- An experience you want to have
- A version of yourself you want to become

The unfinished business of your life is a reason to stay. Not forever—just long enough to do some of it.

---

<Exercise title="Your Reasons">

What are your reasons to stay?

<Journal
  id="wefb-reasons"
  prompt="What are your reasons to keep going?

They don't have to be big. They just have to be true.

PEOPLE:

CURIOSITIES:

THINGS UNFINISHED:

SMALL THINGS THAT MATTER:

ANYTHING ELSE:"

## When You Can't Find Reasons

If you're searching and finding nothing—that's important information.

It might mean:
- The pain is so intense it's blocking everything else
- You need support you don't have
- This is bigger than self-help can address

**Please reach out:**
- To a therapist or counselor
- To a crisis line (988 in US)
- To a hospital if necessary
- To anyone who can help

Not being able to find reasons to stay is a sign of how much pain you're in. It's not a sign that there aren't reasons—it's a sign you need help finding them.

---

## Staying Is the Start

You don't have to want to live right now. You don't have to feel hopeful or optimistic. You don't have to see how things get better.

You just have to stay.

Staying is the prerequisite for everything else. If you stay, there's possibility. If you stay, things can change. If you stay, the pain can eventually transform.

But you have to stay to find out.

---

## Key Ideas

- Reasons to stay don't have to be grand—they can be small and true
- People matter: who would miss you, who depends on you
- Curiosity about the future is a valid reason
- Spite and defiance count
- Unfinished business keeps you here
- If you can't find reasons, you need more support
- Staying is the foundation for everything that comes after
- You matter. Please stay.

---

*The darkest moments pass. But you have to be here to see it. Please stay. The world needs you in it.*
