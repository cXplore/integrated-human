## The Future Is Too Much

When life has collapsed, looking at the future can be overwhelming:

- How will I get through the next year?
- How will I rebuild?
- How will I ever be okay?
- How do I live with this?

These questions are too big. They require answers you don't have. And trying to answer them from rock bottom is like trying to run a marathon with broken legs.

---

## The Strategy: Shrink the Frame

When everything is too much, we shrink the frame:

- **Can't think about your life?** Think about this year.
- **Year too much?** Think about this month.
- **Month too much?** Think about this week.
- **Week too much?** Think about today.
- **Today too much?** Think about this hour.
- **Hour too much?** Think about the next five minutes.

Keep shrinking until you find a timeframe you can handle. That's your only job.

---

## One Day at a Time

There's wisdom in the old recovery mantra: one day at a time.

When you wake up in devastation, the question isn't "How will I live my whole life like this?" The question is: "Can I get through today?"

Just today. That's the unit. Wake up, exist through the hours, go to sleep. That's a win.

Tomorrow you can do it again. But you don't have to think about tomorrow yet.

You don't have to figure out your whole life. You just have to get through today. That's the only assignment.

## When Even Today Is Too Much

Sometimes a day is too long. That's okay. Shrink further:

**One hour at a time:**
- What do I need to get through this hour?
- That's my only focus.
- In an hour, I'll reassess.

**One task at a time:**
- What's the single next thing?
- Can I do just that?
- Good. Now what's after that?

**One breath at a time:**
- I'm breathing in.
- I'm breathing out.
- That's all.

<Exercise title="Your Frame">

How small do you need to shrink the frame right now?

<Journal
  id="wefb-frame"
  prompt="What timeframe can you handle right now?

• This year?
• This month?
• This week?
• Today?
• This hour?
• The next few minutes?

What's the smallest frame that feels manageable?"
  placeholder="Right now I can think about..."
  rows={8}

</Exercise>

## The Next Few Hours

If you can handle the next few hours, here's what that might look like:

1. **Basic needs:** Have you eaten? Drunk water? Used the bathroom?
2. **Basic comfort:** Are you warm enough? Is there anything making things worse that you could change?
3. **Basic company:** Is there anyone you could be near (even virtually)?
4. **Basic rest:** Could you lie down? Close your eyes?

That's it. That's a successful few hours when everything is broken.

## Don't Make Big Decisions

This is important: when you're at rock bottom, don't make major life decisions.

- Don't quit your job
- Don't end (or start) relationships
- Don't move cities
- Don't make permanent choices

Your judgment is compromised by crisis. Wait until you've stabilized before making decisions you can't undo.

The only decision right now: survive today.

---

## Maintenance Mode

When life falls apart, you switch to maintenance mode:

**What stays:**
- Basic self-care (enough)
- Essential responsibilities (the bare minimum)
- Survival activities

**What pauses:**
- Self-improvement
- Productivity
- Big projects
- Social obligations
- Non-essential anything

This isn't giving up. It's strategic conservation of energy during emergency. You can expand again later.

---

<Exercise title="Maintenance Mode">

What can you pause right now?

<Journal
  id="wefb-maintenance"
  prompt="ESSENTIAL (must keep doing):

PAUSE (can wait until later):

What can you let go of right now to conserve energy?"
  placeholder="ESSENTIAL:

PAUSE:"
  rows={12}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Kindness of Low Standards

Right now, everything you accomplish is bonus.

- Got out of bed? Win.
- Ate something? Win.
- Made it through an hour? Win.
- Didn't make things worse? Win.
- Still breathing? Win.

Your standards for success right now should be: still alive at the end of the day. Everything else is extra credit.

---

## It Adds Up

One day might not seem like much. But days add up.

Seven days becomes a week. Four weeks becomes a month. Twelve months becomes a year.

Each day you survive is proof that you can. Each day creates a little more distance from the acute crisis. Each day, the intensity drops imperceptibly.

You won't feel it happening. But it is.

---

## Key Ideas

- When the future is too much, shrink the frame
- One day at a time—or less if needed
- Don't make major decisions from rock bottom
- Switch to maintenance mode—essential only
- Low standards are kind standards right now
- Just getting through today is the goal
- Days add up, even when it doesn't feel like it

---

*You don't have to figure out your life. You just have to get through today.*
