## Rock Bottom

Maybe your life has fallen apart.

Maybe everything you built—your relationship, your health, your career, your sense of self—is in ruins. Maybe you've lost someone or something that was central to who you are. Maybe you've hit a wall so hard that you don't know how to get up.

This course is for those moments. Not to fix anything. Not to offer platitudes. Just to be with you in the wreckage.

---

## What "Broken" Feels Like

When everything falls apart, it might feel like:

- The world has ended but somehow you're still here
- You're hollow, empty, destroyed
- Nothing makes sense anymore
- The future is blank or terrifying
- You don't know who you are
- You can't imagine how life goes on from here

These feelings are appropriate responses to devastating circumstances. You're not being dramatic. You're responding to real loss, real trauma, real collapse.

---

## No Shortcuts

There's no hack for this. No technique that makes it okay. No reframe that makes it hurt less.

When life falls apart, the only way out is through. And "through" isn't a straight line—it's messy, nonlinear, and much slower than anyone wants.

This course isn't going to fix that. What it offers instead is companionship for the journey and tools for surviving it.

You don't have to be okay with what's happening. You don't have to find the silver lining. You don't have to learn the lesson yet. You just have to survive it.

## What Actually Happened

Sometimes it helps to name it. Sometimes it doesn't. Only you know.

If it feels right, you can acknowledge what happened:

<Exercise title="Naming the Collapse">

Only if it feels safe, name what's happened.

<Journal
  id="wefb-naming"
  prompt="If you're willing, write what has broken. What has fallen apart? What have you lost?

(You don't have to explain or justify. Just name it.)"
  placeholder="What has broken is..."
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Unsurvivable Gets Survived

Here is a strange truth about devastation: it gets survived.

Not quickly. Not easily. Not without scars. But somehow, people keep going after things they were sure would end them.

This isn't inspiration. It's just fact. The human capacity for survival is staggering—even when we can't see it in ourselves.

You don't have to believe you'll survive this. You just have to keep existing long enough to find out.

---

## What's Not Required

Right now, you don't have to:

- **Heal** — That's a long process with no timetable
- **Understand** — Some things can't be understood
- **Forgive** — Not required, especially not now
- **Find meaning** — Meaning can come later, or not at all
- **Be strong** — You're allowed to fall apart
- **Move on** — There's no schedule for grief or recovery

The only requirement is to still be here tomorrow. Everything else is optional.

---

## Permission

You have permission to:

- Cry as much as you need
- Be angry, numb, devastated
- Not function at full capacity
- Let things slide
- Need help
- Not be okay
- Take as long as you need
- Feel whatever you feel

No one gets to tell you how to survive your own life falling apart.

---

<Exercise title="What You Need Permission For">

What do you need permission for right now?

<Journal
  id="wefb-permission"
  prompt="What do you need permission for? What are you judging yourself for needing or feeling?

Write it down. Consider this your permission slip."
  placeholder="I need permission to..."
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Smallest Hope

You don't need grand hope right now. You don't need to see how this turns out okay. You just need the smallest thread:

- One more day to see what happens
- One person who would miss you
- One thing you're curious about
- One reason to stay

That's enough. It doesn't have to be inspiring. It just has to be true.

---

## Key Ideas

- When everything falls apart, acknowledgment comes first
- There are no shortcuts through devastation
- The unsurvivable gets survived (not quickly, not easily)
- Right now, you don't have to heal, understand, or move on
- You only have to still be here
- Permission is yours—to feel, to need, to not be okay
- The smallest hope is enough for now

*The wreckage is real. But so are you. And you're still here.*
