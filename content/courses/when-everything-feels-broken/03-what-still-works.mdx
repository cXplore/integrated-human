## Not Everything Is Broken

When life collapses, it feels total. Everything is ruined. Nothing works. The destruction is complete.

But look closer. Usually, not *everything* is broken.

There are things that still work. Small things, maybe. But real things. And these become your anchors while you rebuild.

---

## The Inventory

Even in devastation, there are usually:

**Things that still function:**
- Your body (at least partly)
- Basic routines that still happen
- A place to sleep
- Access to food and water

**People who are still there:**
- Someone who cares
- Someone who would answer if you called
- Maybe just one person—but one is enough

**Parts of you that remain:**
- Your ability to observe what's happening
- Your values (even if you can't live them fully)
- Things you still care about (however dimly)
- Skills and knowledge you've accumulated

**Small comforts:**
- A pet
- A song
- A show you can watch
- A smell or taste that's still good

Take inventory of what's still here.

## Anchors

In a storm, you need anchors—things that keep you from being swept away entirely.

Your anchors might be:

- **A person:** Someone who knows you, who you can contact
- **A pet:** Something that needs you, that loves you unconditionally
- **A routine:** Something that happens every day regardless
- **A place:** Somewhere that feels relatively safe
- **An object:** Something you can hold, that grounds you
- **A practice:** Something you do that helps (walking, music, breathing)

Find your anchors. Know what they are. When the storm intensifies, grab them.

---

## The One Thing Rule

When everything is overwhelming, find one thing:

- **One person** you can reach out to
- **One thing** you can look forward to (even small)
- **One reason** to keep going
- **One activity** that helps a little

You don't need many things. You need one thing. One anchor is enough to hold you until the storm passes.

<Callout type="gentle">
You don't need everything to be okay. You just need one thing that isn't broken. One thread. One anchor. That's enough to build on.

## What You Haven't Lost

In loss, we focus on what's gone. That makes sense. But what remains?

Some things can't be taken:

- **Your history:** What you've lived, learned, survived
- **Your capacity:** Even if diminished, you still have abilities
- **Your awareness:** You're still here, still experiencing
- **Your future:** It's unwritten, uncertain, but possible

These might not feel like much right now. But they're the foundation for whatever comes next.

---

<Exercise title="What Remains">

What hasn't been lost?

<Journal
  id="wefb-remains"
  prompt="Focus on what's still here, not what's gone.

What hasn't been taken or destroyed?
What do you still have, still know, still carry?
What part of you is still intact?"
  placeholder="What remains is..."
  rows={10}

## Small Helps

When everything is broken, small helps matter more than ever:

- A warm shower
- A cup of tea or coffee
- A walk outside
- A familiar song
- A conversation with someone safe
- A weighted blanket
- A good cry
- A bad movie
- Sleep

These don't fix anything. They don't solve the crisis. But they make the next hour survivable. And that's the job right now.

---

## Building on What Works

Later—not now, but later—what still works becomes the foundation for rebuilding.

The relationships that survived become the community you rebuild in.
The routines that held become the structure you expand from.
The parts of yourself that remained become the person you become next.

You don't have to think about this yet. But know: what still works isn't just survival. It's seed material for what comes after.

---

## Key Ideas

- Not everything is broken—take inventory
- Find your anchors: people, routines, places, objects
- One thing is enough—one anchor, one person, one reason
- Focus on what remains, not just what's lost
- Small helps matter enormously right now
- What still works becomes the foundation for later

*In the wreckage, something survived. Find it. Hold it. It will carry you through.*
