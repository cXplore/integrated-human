## The Wanting Woman

Women are taught to suppress wanting. To take less. To not be too much. To put others' desires before their own.

The result: Women who don't know what they want, who feel guilty for wanting, who've lost access to desire altogether.

**Reclaiming desire is reclaiming your life force.**

## What Was Suppressed

### The Messages:
- "Don't be greedy"
- "Good girls don't want too much"
- "Be satisfied with what you have"
- "Think of others first"
- "Wanting is selfish"

### The Result:
- Not knowing what you want
- Guilt when you do want
- Suppressed desire coming out sideways
- Life force dampened

## Types of Desire

### Not Just Sexual:
Desire includes:
- What you want to create
- Who you want to become
- How you want to live
- What experiences you want
- What you want in relationship
- What pleasure you want
- What success you want
- What rest you want

### Sexual Too:
Sexual desire is part of life force. We'll address it here too.

## Reconnecting with Wanting

### The Practice:

**Notice When You Want:**
Pay attention when something pulls you. Attraction, interest, draw.

**Ask Regularly:**
"What do I want right now?" Ask throughout the day.

**Feel in the Body:**
Desire is a body sensation. Where do you feel it?

**Don't Edit:**
Let yourself want without immediately censoring.

## The Guilt About Wanting

### Why It's There:
You were trained to feel guilty. Wanting = selfish = bad.

### The Truth:
Wanting is not wrong. It's life force. It's how you know what to move toward.

### Working with Guilt:
- Notice it arising
- Recognize it as conditioning
- Feel it without believing it
- Choose to want anyway

---

## Pleasure as Medicine

### The Suppression:
Many women have complicated relationships with pleasure—guilt, shame, feeling undeserving.

### The Truth:
Pleasure is healing. It regulates the nervous system. It connects you to your body. It's medicine.

### Types of Pleasure:
- Physical pleasure (touch, warmth, sensation)
- Sensory pleasure (beauty, taste, smell)
- Creative pleasure (making things)
- Relational pleasure (connection)
- Sexual pleasure
- Rest as pleasure

## Sexual Desire

### The Suppression:
Female sexuality has been controlled, shamed, commodified, and feared.

### The Result:
Many women are disconnected from their own sexual desire—don't know what they want, feel shame about wanting.

### Reclaiming:
- Your sexuality is yours
- Your desire is valid
- You get to want what you want
- Shame is conditioning, not truth

---

## Pleasure Practice

### Daily Pleasure:
Build small pleasures into every day—not waiting for special occasions.

### Examples:
- Quality time with something beautiful
- Food you truly enjoy (without guilt)
- Touch that feels good
- Movement that's pleasurable
- Rest when you need it
- Connection that nourishes

### The Permission:
You deserve pleasure. Today. Every day.

## Desire and Action

### Knowing vs. Acting:
First, reconnect with wanting. Then, decide what to pursue.

### Not All Desires Need Action:
Some desires are just felt and allowed. Others call for action.

### When to Act:
- It aligns with your values
- It doesn't harm others inappropriately
- It serves your becoming
- It feels right in the body

## The Desiring Woman

### What She's Like:
- Knows what she wants
- Not apologetic about wanting
- Connected to her life force
- Allows pleasure
- Takes action on desire
- Fully alive

### This Is Available:
Not just for some women. For you.

*Your desire is not too much. You are not too much. The wanting that was trained out of you is your life force—the energy that makes you create, reach, grow, live. When you reclaim your desire, you reclaim your aliveness. Want what you want. Pleasure is allowed. You are allowed.*
