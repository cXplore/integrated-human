## The Knowing You Dismissed

There's a knowing in you that doesn't come from logic or analysis. A gut sense. A body wisdom. An intuition.

You've probably dismissed it countless times. Been told it wasn't valid. Overridden it with "reason." Doubted yourself.

**Your intuition is intelligence. Learning to trust it changes everything.**

---

## What Intuition Is

### Not Magic:
Intuition is not mystical. It's the body-mind processing information faster than conscious thought.

### Forms It Takes:
- Gut feelings
- Body sensations
- Immediate knowing
- Dreams and images
- Subtle attractions and repulsions
- "Something's off" feelings

### What It's Based On:
Pattern recognition, accumulated experience, emotional processing—all happening below conscious awareness.

---

## Why Women Doubt Their Knowing

### The Messages:
- "You're being irrational"
- "Don't be so emotional"
- "What's your evidence?"
- "You're overreacting"
- "That's just your imagination"

### The Result:
You learn to distrust your own perception. To defer to others. To override what you know.

### The Cost:
Decisions that don't serve you. Relationships you knew were wrong. Opportunities missed. Your own wisdom abandoned.

## Reclaiming Your Intuition

### The Practice:

**1. Notice:**
Pay attention to gut feelings, body responses, immediate knowing.

**2. Honor:**
Take them seriously. Don't immediately dismiss.

**3. Track:**
Keep track of intuitions and outcomes. See how accurate you are.

**4. Act:**
Start acting on intuition in low-stakes situations. Build trust.

## Intuition in the Body

### Where You Feel It:
- Gut (hence "gut feeling")
- Heart
- Throat
- Whole-body response
- Constriction or expansion

### The Language:
Learn YOUR body's language. How does "yes" feel? How does "no" feel?

## Types of Knowing

### Intuition vs. Fear:
This is the tricky part. How do you know if it's intuition or anxiety?

### Distinguishing:

**Intuition Tends To:**
- Feel calm or neutral (even if the message is alarming)
- Come clearly and stay consistent
- Not have a quality of urgency/panic
- Feel true in the body

**Fear Tends To:**
- Feel anxious, urgent
- Repeat obsessively
- Shift and change
- Feel contracted and panicky

### Not Always Clear:
Sometimes it's mixed. Practice helps you distinguish.

---

## Intuition in Decisions

### For Big Decisions:

**1. Gather Information:**
Do the logical analysis too. Intuition works WITH reasoning.

**2. Sit With It:**
Let the decision simmer. Don't rush.

**3. Notice Body:**
How does each option feel in the body?

**4. Trust:**
When you know, you know. Act on it.

---

<Exercise title="Decision Practice">

Think of a current decision. Feel into each option with your body. What does your intuition say?

  prompt="Current decision:&#10;&#10;How does option A feel in body?&#10;&#10;Option B?&#10;&#10;What does intuition say?"

## Intuition About People

### You Usually Know:
Most women can sense people's energy, trustworthiness, intentions—but often override this knowing.

### What You Sense:
- Is this person safe?
- What are they really feeling?
- What's their intention?
- Can I trust them?

### The Override:
You sense something's off but talk yourself out of it. "I'm being judgmental." "I should give them a chance."

### The Permission:
You're allowed to trust your read on people. It's often accurate.

---

## Intuition About Situations

### Sensing the Room:
- Energy in a space
- What's really going on
- When something's off
- What's about to happen

### Trust It:
If something feels wrong, it often is.

## Building Intuition

### Practices:

**Daily Check-In:**
Each morning, ask: "What do I need to know today?" Listen.

**Before Sleep:**
Ask a question. See what comes in dreams or morning knowing.

**After Decisions:**
Track outcomes. Were your intuitions accurate?

**Body Awareness:**
The more you're in your body, the more intuition you can access.

**Quiet Time:**
Intuition speaks in quiet. Create space to hear it.

---

## When Intuition Conflicts with Logic

### It Happens:
Sometimes what you "know" doesn't make logical sense.

### What to Do:
- Honor both
- Don't automatically override intuition
- Investigate more if needed
- Sometimes intuition knows what logic can't see

### The Balance:
Intuition AND reason. Not one over the other.

In Module 9, you'll learn about boundaries and fierce love—protecting your energy without closing your heart.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice tuning into intuition daily
- Notice when you dismiss your knowing
- Act on intuition in one small way

---

*You've always known. Every time you said "I knew I shouldn't have..." you were acknowledging the intuition you overrode. The knowing that was dismissed as irrational, emotional, or not evidence-based—that was your intelligence. Not lesser than logic—different. And when you learn to trust it, you have access to guidance that logic alone could never provide.*
