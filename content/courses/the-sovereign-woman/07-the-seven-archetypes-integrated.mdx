## The Full Spectrum

Within every woman are multiple archetypes—ancient patterns of feminine energy that exist across cultures and through time.

Most women have developed some and suppressed others. Full feminine development means access to all of them.

**The sovereign woman can draw on any archetype as the moment requires.**

*You are not just one thing. You are Maiden and Crone. Hunter and Lover. Wild and ordered. The culture that told you to be one thing—nice, small, pleasant—was lying. You contain multitudes. When you can access all the archetypes, you have the full range of feminine power. No situation is without response. No aspect of life is foreign. You become complete.*
