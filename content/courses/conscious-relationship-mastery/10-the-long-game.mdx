## Love That Lasts

Getting into a relationship is one thing. Keeping it alive over years and decades is another entirely. Love that lasts isn't just initial attraction sustained—it's something built, tended, and evolved over time. This final module is about the long game: what it takes to sustain conscious love for a lifetime.

## The Reality of Long-Term Love

### What Changes

Over time, relationships naturally change:
- Initial passion evolves
- You know each other deeply (less mystery)
- Life adds complexity (careers, children, challenges)
- Comfort can become complacency
- What once was exciting becomes familiar

### What Can Grow

With intention, relationships can also:
- Deepen in intimacy and trust
- Become more secure and stable
- Develop richer understanding
- Build shared history and meaning
- Achieve profound partnership

### The Choice

Long-term love is not automatic:
- Requires ongoing choice
- Demands continued effort
- Needs conscious attention
- Involves continual renewal
- Is built through countless daily moments

## The Stages of Relationship

Relationships typically move through:

**1. Romance (Falling in Love)**
- Intense attraction

**3. Stability (If you make it)**
- Acceptance of differences
- Conflict skills developed

- Weathered storms together
- Love as verb

### Where Relationships Die

Many relationships die in stage 2:

Growth requires:

<Callout type="important">
Love that lasts isn't a lucky accident. It's built through thousands of conscious choices, through showing up again and again, through repair when things break, through growth when comfort beckons stagnation. The long game is the only game worth playing. May you play it well.
</Callout>

*Love is what remains when everything else falls away—if you've built it well.*
