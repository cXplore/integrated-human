## How You Bond

Attachment theory is one of the most powerful frameworks for understanding relationships. How you attach—the patterns of bonding developed in childhood—shapes every intimate relationship you have. Understanding your attachment style transforms how you relate.

---

## Attachment Theory Basics

### The Foundation

Attachment theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth):
- Early relationships create internal working models
- These models shape how you bond later
- Patterns are stable but can change
- Understanding enables growth

### How It Develops

Your attachment developed from:
- How caregivers responded to your needs
- Consistency and reliability of care
- Attunement and emotional responsiveness
- Whether you felt safe and secure

### Why It Matters

Attachment matters because it affects:
- How you experience intimacy
- What you do in relationship stress
- How you communicate needs
- Whether you can trust and depend
- How relationships unfold
