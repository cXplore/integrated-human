## They Won't All Like It

Here's the uncomfortable truth: when you stop people-pleasing, some people won't be happy.

The people who benefited from your self-abandonment may resist your change.

**This doesn't mean you're doing something wrong. It means you're doing something real.**

---

## Why People React

### They Were Used to the Old Pattern:
- Your accommodating nature was convenient
- They didn't have to consider your needs
- The relationship worked for them (at your expense)

### Change Is Disorienting:
- "This isn't the person I know"
- Their expectations are being disrupted
- They don't know how to respond

### They Feel Criticized:
- Your new boundaries may feel like rejection
- As if you're saying they were wrong
- Even though it's about you, not them

### Their Own Stuff Gets Triggered:
- Your change may highlight their issues
- Seeing you set boundaries threatens their avoidance
- Your growth can feel threatening

---

## Common Reactions You'll Face

### Surprise/Confusion:
"That's not like you"
"What's going on?"
"Are you okay?"

### Disappointment:
Visible letdown
Sighing, withdrawing
Making you feel guilty

### Anger:
"You're being selfish"
"I thought you cared"
"You've changed"

### Manipulation:
Guilt-tripping
Playing victim
Using history against you

### Testing:
Pushing against boundaries
Asking repeatedly
Escalating requests

## What Not to Do

### Don't Backtrack:
- "Never mind, I'll do it"
- Abandoning your position because they're upset
- This teaches them pushing works

### Don't Over-Explain:
- Long justifications
- Trying to make them understand
- Endless defense of your position

### Don't Apologize for Having Needs:
- "I'm so sorry to be difficult"
- "I know this is inconvenient"
- Your needs aren't crimes

### Don't Get Pulled Into Arguments:
- JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain) keeps you hooked
- You can hold your position without convincing them
- It's not a debate

---

## What to Do Instead

### Stay Calm:
- Breathe
- Regulate your nervous system
- Don't let their upset become your emergency

### Acknowledge Without Caving:
- "I hear that you're disappointed"
- "I understand this is frustrating"
- "I can see this isn't what you wanted"

### Hold Your Position:
- Repeat your boundary calmly
- "I understand, and I still can't do that"
- Broken record technique

### Don't Make It Personal:
- This is about your limits, not their worth
- "It's not that you're not important to me"
- But don't endlessly reassure either

### Leave if Needed:
- You can walk away from escalation
- "We can talk when things are calmer"
- You don't have to stay for abuse

  prompt="Write some scripts for handling reactions. What will you say when someone is disappointed? Angry? Pushing back? Practice having something ready."

</Exercise>

## The Broken Record Technique

When someone keeps pushing:

### The Method:
1. State your position clearly
2. When they push back, repeat (same or similar words)
3. Don't escalate, don't elaborate, don't defend
4. Just keep calmly repeating

### Example:
Them: "But I really need you to"
You: "I understand, and I can't this time"
Them: "Come on, just this once"
You: "I hear you, and I'm not able to"
Them: "You always do this"
You: "I understand you're frustrated, and my answer is still no"

**You don't have to win the argument. You just have to hold your position.**

## Managing Your Internal Response

Their reaction will trigger you. Plan for it:

### When Guilt Arises:
- Notice it: "There's guilt"
- Don't let it decide: "Guilt doesn't mean I'm wrong"
- Remind yourself: "Their disappointment isn't my emergency"

### When Fear Arises:
- Feel it in your body
- Breathe through it
- Remember: "I can survive their displeasure"

### When Doubt Arises:
- "Maybe I am being selfish"
- Counter: "Having needs isn't selfish"
- Stay with your decision

### Get Support After:
- Process with a safe person
- Celebrate holding your ground
- Debrief what happened

## Distinguishing Reasonable from Unreasonable Reactions

### Reasonable Reactions Include:
- Initial surprise
- Genuine disappointment (expressed appropriately)
- Questions to understand
- Adjustment to the new dynamic
- Eventual acceptance

### Unreasonable Reactions Include:
- Prolonged rage
- Manipulation and guilt-tripping
- Punishment (silent treatment, withdrawal)
- Threatening
- Refusing to accept any no ever

**Reasonable people can handle disappointment. Unreasonable people use your discomfort against you.**

---

## The Information in Reactions

How people respond tells you something:

### Positive Signs:
- They adjust (even if disappointed)
- They respect your position
- The relationship recalibrates
- They may even appreciate your honesty

### Warning Signs:
- They refuse to accept any boundary
- They escalate or punish
- They only value you when accommodating
- The relationship can't survive you having needs

**These reactions reveal who your relationships were really with. Some people loved the performing you. Not everyone will love the real you—and that's information.**

## Grief in the Process

As you stop people-pleasing, you may face:

### What You Might Grieve:
- Relationships that can't adjust
- The fantasy of being loved for performing
- The strategy that kept you "safe"
- The person you were (even if it wasn't authentic)

### This Is Normal:
- Change involves loss
- Grief is part of growth
- You're losing something, even if it wasn't good for you

### Allow It:
- Feel the sadness
- Don't rush through
- This is the price of becoming real

---

## The Other Side

Many people find on the other side:

### Better Relationships:
- With people who love the real you
- More honest and intimate
- Less exhausting

### Self-Respect:
- Knowing you can advocate for yourself
- Trust in your own backbone
- Pride in your growth

### Freedom:
- From managing everyone's feelings
- From chronic exhaustion
- To live your actual life

**The reactions you fear are the doorway to the life you want.**

  prompt="What's on the other side of handling others' reactions? What might your life and relationships look like when you've come through this? What's worth facing the discomfort for?"

- **Don't Backtrack:** Their upset doesn't mean you're wrong.

- **Stay Regulated:** Their emergency isn't your emergency.

- **Broken Record:** Repeat your position calmly without defending.

- **Reactions Are Information:** How people respond reveals the true nature of the relationship.

## What's Next

In Module 6, you'll learn how to build sustainable change—creating a life that naturally includes your own needs.

**Before moving on:**
- Anticipate reactions you might face
- Prepare responses
- Practice staying regulated when triggered

---

*Some people will prefer the performing you. The people who matter will prefer the real you—and that's who you're doing this for, including yourself.*
