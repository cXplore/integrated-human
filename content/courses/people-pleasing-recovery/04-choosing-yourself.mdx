## From Understanding to Action

You've seen the pattern. You understand where it came from. You've felt the fear.

Now: how do you actually start choosing yourself?

**This module is practical. Specific steps, concrete practices, real change.**

---

## What "Choosing Yourself" Means

### It Means:
- Including your needs in decisions
- Saying no when you need to
- Expressing preferences and opinions
- Not automatically abandoning yourself
- Being honest about what you want

### It Doesn't Mean:
- Becoming selfish or uncaring
- Never helping anyone
- Always getting your way
- Ignoring others' needs entirely
- Being aggressive or mean

**Choosing yourself is about inclusion—including yourself in the picture, not excluding everyone else.**

---

## The Basics: Knowing What You Want

Many people-pleasers have lost touch with their own desires.

### The Problem:
- You're so focused on others, you don't know what you want
- "What do you want?" causes panic
- You've outsourced your preferences

### The Practice:
Start noticing your internal signals:
- "What do I actually want to eat?"
- "Do I actually want to go to this?"
- "What's my real opinion?"
- "How do I feel about this?"

**Before you can choose yourself, you have to find yourself.**

  prompt="In the next few days, pause before answering questions about preferences. What restaurant do YOU want? What movie? What plans? Notice what comes up when you check inside instead of outside."

## Step 1: Create a Pause

People-pleasing is fast. It happens before you think.

### The Automatic Pattern:
Request → Automatic yes → Regret later

### The New Pattern:
Request → PAUSE → Consider → Respond

### How to Pause:
- "Let me think about that"
- "I'll get back to you"
- "I need to check my calendar"
- "Give me a moment"
- Simply: silence

**The pause breaks the automatic pattern. In that pause, choice becomes possible.**

<Exercise title="Practicing the Pause">

<Journal
  id="practicing-pause"
  prompt="This week, practice pausing before responding to requests. Even if you end up saying yes, pause first. What happens when you create that gap? What do you notice?"
  placeholder="Times I practiced pausing:&#10;&#10;What I noticed:&#10;&#10;What was difficult:&#10;&#10;What happened when I paused:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Step 2: Check Inside

During the pause, ask yourself:

### Key Questions:
- "Do I actually want to do this?"
- "Do I have capacity for this?"
- "What would I need to say yes genuinely?"
- "What's my honest feeling?"

### Body Signals:
- Does your body open or contract?
- Is there a "yes" feeling or a "no" feeling?
- Notice your gut, chest, shoulders
- The body often knows before the mind

---

## Step 3: Tolerate the Discomfort

Saying no (or being honest) will feel uncomfortable.

### What You'll Feel:
- Fear of their reaction
- Guilt about disappointing them
- Anxiety about consequences
- The pull to just say yes

### What to Do:
- Expect the discomfort
- Breathe through it
- Remember: discomfort isn't danger
- The feeling will pass

**You can feel uncomfortable and still act in your interest. This is a core skill.**

---

## Step 4: Speak Your Truth

Now say what's true:

### Simple Phrases:
- "I can't do that"
- "That doesn't work for me"
- "I need to pass on this one"
- "I'd prefer not to"
- "I have other plans" (even if the plan is rest)

### Fuller Responses:
- "I'd like to help, but I don't have capacity right now"
- "I can do X but not Y"
- "That time doesn't work—could we try Z?"

### What You Don't Need:
- Long justifications
- Elaborate excuses
- Permission
- Their approval of your no

**"No" is a complete sentence. You don't owe explanations for having limits.**

<Exercise title="Saying No Practice">

<Journal
  id="saying-no-practice"
  prompt="What phrase will you use when you need to say no? Practice writing it out. Then think of a low-stakes situation where you could use it."
  placeholder="My go-to phrase for saying no:&#10;&#10;A low-stakes situation to practice:&#10;&#10;What I'll say:"

## Starting Small

Don't start with the hardest situations.

### The Progression:
1. **Low stakes:** Choosing where to eat, declining spam calls
2. **Medium stakes:** Saying no to extra tasks at work, declining social invitations
3. **Higher stakes:** Setting limits with family, having difficult conversations

### Why Small First:
- Build muscle gradually
- Gather evidence that you survive
- Let the nervous system adjust
- Success builds confidence

---

## The STOP Technique

When you notice you're about to people-please:

### S - Stop
Pause before responding

### T - Take a breath
Regulate your nervous system

### O - Observe
What's happening inside? What do you want?

### P - Proceed
Respond from choice, not autopilot

---

## Specific Situations

### When Asked to Do Something:
- Pause
- Check if you genuinely want to/can
- If no: "I can't this time" or "That doesn't work for me"
- If maybe: "Let me check and get back to you"

### When Asked Your Opinion:
- Notice what you actually think
- Say it (even if different from others)
- "I actually think..." or "For me, it's..."

### When Someone's Upset:
- You can witness without fixing
- "I hear that you're upset"
- Their feelings aren't your emergency

### When You've Already Said Yes:
- It's okay to change your mind
- "I need to adjust—I won't be able to after all"
- Better late honesty than resentful follow-through

<Exercise title="Planning for Situations">

<Journal
  id="situation-planning"
  prompt="Choose three specific situations where you typically people-please. For each, write what you'll do differently—what you'll say, how you'll pause, what you'll do with the discomfort."
  placeholder="Situation 1:&#10;What I'll do differently:&#10;&#10;Situation 2:&#10;What I'll do differently:&#10;&#10;Situation 3:&#10;What I'll do differently:"

## Self-Care Isn't Selfish

Choosing yourself includes:

### Basic Self-Care:
- Rest when tired
- Eat when hungry
- Say no when depleted
- Take breaks
- Ask for help

### This Isn't Selfish:
- You can't pour from an empty cup
- Caring for yourself enables caring for others
- Martyrdom isn't noble—it's unsustainable
- You matter as much as anyone else

---

## Building Support

Change is easier with support:

### Tell Safe People:
- "I'm working on saying no more"
- "I'm trying to express my preferences"
- "Please be patient as I practice"

### Find Allies:
- People who will celebrate your boundaries
- Not people who benefited from your people-pleasing
- Possibly a therapist or coach

### Be Your Own Ally:
- Celebrate small wins
- Forgive slips
- Encourage yourself
- Track progress

---

<Exercise title="Support System">

<Journal
  id="support-system"
  prompt="Who in your life would support you in choosing yourself more? Who might struggle with the change? How will you handle both?"
  placeholder="People who would support me:&#10;&#10;People who might struggle:&#10;&#10;How I'll handle supportive people:&#10;&#10;How I'll handle those who struggle:"
  rows={8}

## When You Slip

You will slip. You'll people-please when you didn't want to.

### What to Do:
1. **Notice it** (better late than never)
2. **Don't beat yourself up** (that's more self-abandonment)
3. **Consider:** Can you correct it? (Sometimes you can renegotiate)
4. **Learn:** What triggered the slip?
5. **Continue:** Next opportunity is coming

### Remember:
- Years of pattern don't change overnight
- Progress isn't linear
- Every return to choosing yourself matters
- You're retraining your nervous system

---

<Exercise title="After a Slip">

<Journal
  id="slip-recovery"
  prompt="Think about a recent time you people-pleased when you didn't want to. Without judgment, what triggered it? What could you do differently next time? What would you say to a friend in the same situation?"
  placeholder="What happened:&#10;&#10;What triggered it:&#10;&#10;What I could do differently:&#10;&#10;What I'd tell a friend:"

### Choose One:
- Say no to one thing
- Express one preference
- Set one small limit

### Track:
- What you tried

---

## Key Concepts

- **Choosing Yourself:** Including your needs, not excluding others.

## What's Next

In Module 5, you'll learn how to handle others' reactions when you stop people-pleasing—because some people won't like the new you.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice the pause throughout the week
- Say one no
- Track what you notice

---

*Choosing yourself isn't a betrayal of others. It's an honoring of yourself that makes real relationship possible.*
