## The Greatest Teacher

Death is perhaps our greatest teacher—if we let it teach. Mortality awareness cuts through illusion, reveals what matters, and invites us to live with urgency and intention.

What would death teach you if you listened?

## What Death Teaches

### The Finite Is Precious

Death teaches:
- Time is limited—each moment matters
- Experiences end—appreciate them now
- Nothing lasts—impermanence is the nature of things
- What's here now won't always be

The finite is precious because it's finite.

### What Truly Matters

Death clarifies:
- Status and achievement fade
- Possessions stay behind
- Relationships are what we cherish
- Love is what remains
- Being present is the point

Near-death survivors consistently report the same insights.

### The Trivial Falls Away

In light of death:
- Petty conflicts seem absurd
- Grudges become pointless
- Worries about status shrink
- Small annoyances fade
- What doesn't matter reveals itself

### The Urgency of Now

Death says:
- Do it now—you may not get another chance
- Say it now—tomorrow isn't guaranteed
- Be present—this moment is all you have
- Don't postpone what matters

## The Deathbed Perspective

### The Common Regrets

Research on dying people reveals common regrets:
- "I wish I'd had the courage to live true to myself"
- "I wish I hadn't worked so hard"
- "I wish I'd expressed my feelings more"
- "I wish I'd stayed in touch with friends"
- "I wish I'd let myself be happier"

### What's Never Regretted

Rarely do people regret:
- Loving too much
- Taking the risk
- Being honest
- Spending time with loved ones
- Following their heart

### The Invitation

Live now so you won't regret then:
- Be true to yourself
- Prioritize relationships
- Express what you feel
- Take meaningful risks
- Choose happiness

## The Stripping Away

### What Death Takes

Death removes:
- Status and title
- Possessions and wealth
- Physical body
- Roles and identities
- Everything external

### What Remains

What goes with you (in various traditions):
- Character and consciousness
- Love given and received
- How you lived
- What you became
- Nothing but essence

### The Question

This raises the question:
- What are you investing in?
- What will remain when all is stripped away?
- What's the point of what you're doing?

## Death as Decision-Maker

### The Mortality Test

For any decision, ask:
- Would I be glad I did this from my deathbed?
- Is this how I want to spend my limited time?
- Does this align with what truly matters?
- If I died tomorrow, would I regret this choice?

### Daily Application

Apply this to:
- How you spend your hours
- What you say yes and no to
- How you treat people
- What you pursue
- What you let go

### Not Morbid, Practical

This isn't obsessing about death:
- It's using mortality as a clarifying lens
- It's letting death inform life
- It's practical wisdom, not dark dwelling

---

## The Present Moment

### Death Points to Now

Death teaches presence:
- The past is gone
- The future isn't guaranteed
- Only now exists
- This moment is your life

### Impermanence and Appreciation

Knowing things end:
- Makes the present precious
- Invites full engagement
- Encourages appreciation
- Creates urgency for presence

### The Eternal Now

Paradoxically:
- Each moment is all we have
- Each moment is complete
- Living fully now is the answer to death
- Presence is how we transcend time

---

## Key Concepts

- **Finite is precious:** Limited time makes moments matter
- **What truly matters:** Relationships, love, presence—not status or stuff
- **Common regrets:** Not being true, working too hard, not expressing, not connecting
- **The stripping:** Death removes externals; what remains?
- **Death as decision-maker:** Use mortality as a lens for choices
- **The present moment:** Death points to now as all we have

<Callout type="important">
Death is a severe teacher. Its lessons are profound but can be uncomfortable. Take what's useful, leave what isn't. The point is to enhance your life, not to create anxiety or depression. If this becomes too heavy, take a break.

*Death doesn't tell you what to do. It tells you what matters. That's everything.*
