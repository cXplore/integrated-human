## Learning to Meditate

Meditation is mindfulness in formal practice. It's when you set aside time specifically to train your attention. This module guides you through your first meditation and teaches you the basics of sitting practice.

---

## Before You Begin

### Setting Up

Find:
- A quiet space (doesn't need to be silent)
- Comfortable seating (chair, cushion, or floor)
- A time you won't be interrupted
- About 5-10 minutes to start

### Posture

Good meditation posture:
- Spine straight but not rigid
- Shoulders relaxed
- Hands resting comfortably
- Head level, chin slightly tucked
- Eyes closed or soft gaze downward

### Attitude

Approach with:
- No expectations
- Curiosity
- Gentleness with yourself
- Willingness to just be

---

## The Basic Practice

### Breath as Anchor

The simplest meditation:
- Focus attention on breathing
- Notice breath coming in
- Notice breath going out
- When mind wanders, return

### Why Breath?

Breath is ideal because:
- It's always happening
- It's always present
- It changes with your state
- It anchors you to now

### The Wandering Mind

Your mind will wander:
- This is completely normal
- Not a sign of failure
- Every meditator experiences this
- The return IS the practice

---

## Guided Meditation

### Your First Sit

Take 5 minutes for this practice:

**1. Settle (30 seconds)**
- Get comfortable
- Close your eyes
- Take a few deep breaths
- Let your body relax

**2. Find Your Breath (1 minute)**
- Notice where you feel breath most
- Maybe the nose, chest, or belly
- Don't change it—just observe
- Let breathing be natural

**3. Stay with Breath (3 minutes)**
- Keep attention on breathing
- When mind wanders, notice
- Gently return to breath
- No judgment—just return

**4. Finish (30 seconds)**
- Take a deeper breath
- Notice how you feel
- Slowly open eyes
- Transition gently

## Common Experiences

### "My Mind Wandered Constantly"

This is normal:
- Everyone's mind wanders
- It doesn't mean you're doing it wrong
- Each return to breath is success
- It gets easier with practice

### "I Didn't Feel Anything Special"

That's fine:
- Meditation isn't about special experiences
- Ordinary awareness is the goal
- Not every sit will feel profound
- Consistency matters more than any single sit

### "I Felt Restless/Bored"

Also normal:
- These are common experiences
- They're just more things to notice
- You don't have to feel peaceful
- Observing restlessness IS mindfulness

### "I Keep Thinking About My To-Do List"

Very common:
- The mind thinks—that's what it does
- Notice the thought, return to breath
- Don't fight the thoughts
- Let them pass like clouds

---

## Building Up

### Start Short

Begin with:
- 5 minutes daily
- Better than 30 minutes once a week
- Consistency over duration
- Build gradually

### Gradual Increase

As practice develops:
- Add 1-2 minutes weekly
- Work toward 10-20 minutes
- Quality matters more than length
- Find what works for you

### When to Practice

Best times:
- Morning (start the day present)
- Before bed (calm the mind)
- Same time daily (builds habit)
- Whenever works consistently for you

<Callout type="important">
You've just taken your first step into meditation. The most important thing now is consistency—not duration, not depth, not special experiences. Just show up daily, sit, breathe, and practice returning attention when it wanders. That simple practice, repeated over time, transforms your relationship with your mind.

*Every meditation is practice. Every return to breath is success.*
