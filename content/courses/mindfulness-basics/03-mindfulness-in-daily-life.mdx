## Beyond the Cushion

Meditation is formal mindfulness practice—but the real point is to bring presence into your whole life. This module teaches you how to be mindful throughout your day, transforming ordinary activities into opportunities for awareness.

---

## Informal Mindfulness

### What It Is

Informal mindfulness:
- Being present during daily activities
- Not separate practice time
- Bringing awareness to what you're already doing
- Life as meditation

### Why It Matters

Informal practice:
- Extends benefits throughout day
- Doesn't require extra time
- Makes practice sustainable
- Transforms ordinary moments
- Is where life actually happens

### The Shift

The shift from autopilot to presence:
- Actually tasting your food
- Really hearing someone speak
- Feeling your feet as you walk
- Being where you are

---

## Mindful Moments

### Choose Routine Activities

Pick activities you already do:
- Brushing teeth
- Showering
- Eating
- Walking
- Washing dishes
- Waiting in line

### Bring Full Attention

For that activity:
- Notice what you're doing
- Engage all senses
- Stay present throughout
- When mind wanders, return

### Start with One

Don't try to be mindful constantly:
- Pick one activity
- Practice mindfulness there
- Build the habit
- Gradually expand

- Habitual patterns with food

### Try It Now

If you can, eat something mindfully:
- A piece of fruit
- A few bites of a meal
- A single snack
- Notice the difference

## Mindful Walking

### The Practice

When walking:

### Opportunities

Walking mindfulness happens:

- Walking down hallway
- Moving through stores

<Callout type="important">
Meditation is training wheels—the real practice is life itself. Every moment is an opportunity for mindfulness. Start with one activity, use the STOP technique throughout the day, and gradually let presence infuse more of your life. This is where mindfulness becomes not just a practice but a way of being.
