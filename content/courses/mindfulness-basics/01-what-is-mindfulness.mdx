## Welcome to Presence

Most of us spend our lives somewhere other than the present moment—lost in thought about the past, worried about the future, or simply not paying attention. Mindfulness offers an alternative: fully being where you are. This course introduces you to the practice that can transform your relationship with life.

## Defining Mindfulness

### What It Is

Mindfulness is:
- Paying attention to the present moment
- On purpose
- Without judgment
- With openness and curiosity

### Simple but Not Easy

The concept is simple:
- Be here now
- Notice what's happening
- Don't judge it

The practice is challenging:
- Our minds wander constantly
- We're conditioned to distraction
- Old patterns pull us away
- It takes practice

### What It's Not

Mindfulness is not:
- Stopping all thoughts
- Feeling blissful all the time
- Escaping from reality
- A religious practice (though it has roots in Buddhism)
- Something only certain people can do

## The Core Elements

### 1. Attention

Observing without evaluating:

<Callout type="important">
Mindfulness isn't about achieving a special state—it's about being aware of whatever state you're in. You don't need to stop thinking, feel perfectly calm, or have any particular experience. You just need to pay attention, right here, right now. That simple shift can transform everything.
