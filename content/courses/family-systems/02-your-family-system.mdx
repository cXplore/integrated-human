moduleNumber: 2

duration: "35 min"

## Your Unique System

Every family is unique. While patterns are common, your family has its own particular configuration—its own rules, roles, alliances, and dynamics.

**This module helps you map your specific family system.**

---

## The Genogram

A genogram is a family tree that includes relationship dynamics, not just who's related to whom.

### What to Include:
- Three generations (grandparents, parents, you)
- Births, deaths, marriages, divorces
- Major events (illness, moves, losses)
- Relationship qualities (close, distant, conflicted)
- Patterns that repeat

### Symbols:
- Squares for males, circles for females
- Marriage lines connecting partners
- Children below parents
- Deceased: X through symbol
- Close relationship: double line
- Distant: dotted line
- Conflicted: zigzag line
