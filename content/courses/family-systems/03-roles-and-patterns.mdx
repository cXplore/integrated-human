## Family Roles

Every family has roles—functions that members fill, often unconsciously.

These roles develop to maintain the family system. They serve a purpose, even when unhealthy.

**You didn't choose your role. It was assigned. But you can change it now.**

### The Hero
- The good one, the achiever
- Makes family look functional
- Responsible, successful
- Carries family pride
- Often first-born

- Blamed for family issues
- Acting out expresses family dysfunction
- Distracts from real problems
- Holds family's shadow

- Withdraws to cope
- Easy to forget

## How Roles Develop

### Assigned by the System:
- Based on birth order
- Based on temperament
- Based on who was needed
- Based on who you resembled
- By default when another left

### Reinforced:
- Family treated you that way
- You got rewarded for the role
- Deviation was punished
- Identity formed around role
- Others expected it

### Becomes Identity:
Eventually, the role feels like who you ARE, not what you DO. This is the trap.

---

## The Cost of Roles

Each role has costs:

### Hero:
- Anxiety, perfectionism
- Can't fail, can't rest
- Identity tied to achievement
- Authentic self buried

### Scapegoat:
- Shame, rejection
- Belief something is wrong with you
- Rebellion or acting out
- Cut off from family

### Lost Child:
- Invisibility, neglected needs
- Difficulty asking for help
- Disconnection
- Doesn't know what they want

### Mascot:
- Can't be serious
- Pain unaddressed
- Feels responsible for others' moods
- Doesn't know own feelings

### Caretaker:
- Exhaustion, resentment
- Neglected self
- Codependency
- Doesn't know how to receive

/>

## Inherited Patterns

Beyond roles, you inherited patterns—ways of being that repeat.

### Types of Patterns:

**Emotional Patterns:**
- How feelings were handled
- What was expressed/suppressed
- How conflict happened

**Relationship Patterns:**
- How people connected
- Trust, distance, closeness
- Gender dynamics

**Communication Patterns:**
- Direct or indirect
- Honest or hidden
- Aggressive or passive

**Coping Patterns:**
- How stress was managed
- Substances, work, food
- Avoidance strategies

## Your Parents' Roles

Your parents also played roles—in their families of origin.

### Consider:
- What role did each parent play growing up?
- How did that affect their parenting?
- What were they trying to heal or repeat?
- What couldn't they give because they didn't receive it?

### The Chain:
Your grandparents' parenting → Your parents' roles → Your parents' parenting → Your role → How you parent/relate now

---

<Exercise title="Parents' History">

<Journal
  id="parent1-role"
  prompt="What do you know (or imagine) about your mother's role in her family? How might this have affected her parenting?"
  placeholder="My mother's role was probably...&#10;&#10;This affected her parenting by..."
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="parent2-role"
  prompt="What do you know (or imagine) about your father's role in his family? How might this have affected his parenting?"
  placeholder="My father's role was probably...&#10;&#10;This affected his parenting by..."
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

- Attachment style plays out

### In Friendships:
- You attract certain types
- You play certain roles
- Old dynamics repeat

### At Work:
- Authority relationship patterns

  prompt="How do your family patterns show up in romantic relationships? What dynamics repeat?"
  placeholder="In romantic relationships, I notice..."
  rows={6}

- Tolerate discomfort
- Let go of old identity
- Build new ways

## Key Concepts

- **Family Roles:** Functions members fill to maintain the system—Hero, Scapegoat, Lost Child, Mascot, Caretaker, etc.

- **Role Cost:** What you lost by playing your role.

- **Inherited Patterns:** Ways of feeling, relating, communicating, and coping passed down.

- **Pattern Repetition:** How old dynamics show up in current relationships.

- **Generational Chain:** How patterns and roles transmit across generations.

---

## What's Next

In Module 4, you'll explore intergenerational transmission—how trauma and patterns pass through generations and how to interrupt the chain.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify your primary role(s)
- Notice patterns repeating in current life
- Consider your parents' histories with compassion

---

*You played the role you were given. Now you can write your own part.*
