## The Trust Problem

Self-sabotage destroys self-trust. Each time you sabotage, you confirm that you can't trust yourself. This makes future action harder—why try if you'll just undermine yourself again? Breaking this cycle requires actively rebuilding self-trust through consistent action.

---

## The Trust Cycle

### The Downward Spiral

Sabotage erodes trust:
1. You commit to something
2. You sabotage
3. Trust in yourself decreases
4. Confidence drops
5. Next commitment feels harder
6. More likely to sabotage
7. Trust decreases further

### The Upward Spiral

Trust rebuilds the opposite way:
1. You commit to something small
2. You follow through
3. Trust in yourself increases
4. Confidence grows
5. Next commitment feels possible
6. More likely to succeed
7. Trust increases further

### The Key

Start with commitments small enough that you'll definitely keep them. Build from there.

## The Power of Small Commitments

### Start Ridiculously Small

Begin with commitments that seem too easy:
- Not "exercise every day"—"put on workout clothes"
- Not "write a book"—"write one sentence"
- Not "eat perfectly"—"have one healthy meal"

### Why Small Works

Small commitments:
- Almost guarantee success
- Create positive experiences
- Begin rebuilding trust
- Make the next step possible

### Build Gradually

Over time:
- Increase commitment slightly
- Only as fast as trust allows
- Better to keep going slowly than to fail fast
- Consistent small > inconsistent big

## Keeping Promises to Yourself

### Treat Yourself Like Someone You Respect

If you promised a friend:
- You'd show up
- You'd follow through
- Breaking the promise would matter
- You'd feel accountable

### Apply This to Yourself

When you promise yourself:
- Take it seriously
- Follow through as you would for others
- Notice when you're about to break it
- Make it matter

### The Message

Keeping self-promises says:
- "I matter"
- "My word to myself counts"
- "I can rely on myself"
- "I'm trustworthy"

---

## Catching Sabotage Early

### Warning Signs

Notice when sabotage is brewing:
- Rationalizing why you can't
- Finding "legitimate" excuses
- Suddenly getting busy with other things
- The familiar feeling of about-to-bail

### The Pause

When you notice warning signs:
- Pause before acting
- Recognize the pattern
- Ask: "What is this protecting me from?"
- Choose consciously

### Interrupt the Pattern

You can:
- Take the smallest possible action anyway
- Talk to the saboteur part
- Call on support
- Remind yourself why this matters

<Exercise title="Your Warning Signs">

Identify your pre-sabotage signals.

BEFORE SABOTAGE:
What happens inside you right before you sabotage?

THE EXCUSES:

## Handling Setbacks

### Setbacks Will Happen

Even with best efforts:
- You'll sometimes fall back
- Old patterns are strong
- Perfect isn't the goal
- What matters is what you do next

### The Difference

What determines the outcome:
- Not whether you setback
- But how you respond to setbacks
- Self-compassion vs. self-attack
- Getting back up vs. giving up

### The Response

After a setback:
- Acknowledge what happened (no denial)
- Have compassion (no brutal self-criticism)
- Learn what you can
- Recommit and continue

---

<Exercise title="Your Setback Plan">

Prepare for how you'll handle setbacks.

<Journal
  id="bst-setback"
  prompt="Plan for setbacks:

WHEN I SETBACK:
What will I tell myself when I sabotage again?

COMPASSION:
Write a compassionate response you can use.

LEARNING:
What questions will I ask to learn from it?

RECOMMITMENT:
How will I get back on track?

THE COMMITMENT:
What do I commit to in how I'll handle setbacks?"

## Building Trust Over Time

### Track Your Wins

Keep evidence of follow-through:
- Note every kept commitment
- Celebrate small wins
- Create a track record
- Let evidence build

### Gradually Increase

As trust builds:
- Slightly bigger commitments
- More challenging goals
- Longer timeframes
- Greater complexity

### Trust as Muscle

Self-trust is built through:
- Repetition
- Consistency
- Time
- Evidence

### The New Identity

Eventually, you become someone who:
- Follows through
- Trusts themselves
- Keeps commitments
- Can rely on themselves

## Key Concepts

- **Trust cycle:** Sabotage erodes trust; follow-through rebuilds it
- **Start small:** Ridiculously small commitments that you'll definitely keep
- **Self-respect:** Treat promises to yourself like promises to someone you respect
- **Warning signs:** Learn to recognize pre-sabotage signals
- **Interrupt patterns:** Pause and choose before sabotage completes
- **Handle setbacks:** Compassion, learn, recommit—not self-attack
- **Build over time:** Track wins, gradually increase, build evidence

---

<Callout type="important">
Self-trust isn't given. It's earned—through action. Every commitment you keep, no matter how small, is a deposit in the trust account. Every broken promise is a withdrawal. You rebuild trust the same way you lost it: one action at a time. Start where you are, keep it small, follow through, and watch the trust grow. This is the foundation for lasting change.
</Callout>

*Trust yourself? You will—when you give yourself evidence that you can.*
