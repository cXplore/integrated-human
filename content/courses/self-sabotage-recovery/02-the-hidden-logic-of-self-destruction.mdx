## There's a Reason

Self-sabotage seems irrational, but it's not. There's always a logic—a reason why part of you believes sabotage is the right move. Understanding this logic is the key to changing the pattern. You can't out-willpower a part of yourself. But you can understand and work with it.

## The Protective Function

### Self-Sabotage as Protection

Most self-sabotage is protective:
- Protecting from failure by not trying
- Protecting from rejection by pushing away
- Protecting from disappointment by expecting the worst
- Protecting from the unknown by staying safe

### The Logic

The reasoning goes:
- "If I don't try, I can't fail"
- "If I leave first, I can't be abandoned"
- "If I stay small, I won't be noticed"
- "If I control the failure, it hurts less"

### The Problem

This protection:
- Made sense at some point
- Served you in the past
- But now costs more than it saves
- Keeps you stuck in old patterns

## Fear of Success

### The Surprising Fear

Sometimes we sabotage not fear of failure, but fear of success:
- What if I actually achieve this?
- What if I can't maintain it?
- What if it changes things?
- What if I don't deserve it?

### Why Success Scares

Success can mean:
- Increased expectations
- More visibility and scrutiny
- Changes in relationships
- Leaving comfort zone
- Proving you could have done it all along

### The Sabotage

So we sabotage to:
- Stay in familiar territory
- Avoid the pressure of success
- Keep things manageable
- Not outgrow our self-image

## Unworthiness and Self-Sabotage

### The Core Issue

Often, sabotage stems from:
- Believing you don't deserve good things
- A fundamental sense of unworthiness
- Deep-seated shame
- "Who am I to have this?"

### The Connection

If you believe you're unworthy:
- Success feels wrong
- Good things feel undeserved
- Sabotage restores "order"
- You return to where you "belong"

### The Thermostat

Self-worth acts like a thermostat:
- Set to a certain level
- When life exceeds it, you sabotage to come back down
- When life falls below it, you strive to come back up
- The setting controls your life

## Upper Limits

### Gay Hendricks' Concept

The "upper limit problem":
- Each person has a tolerance for good feelings
- When you exceed it, discomfort arises
- You unconsciously bring yourself back down
- Through sabotage, conflict, or drama

### Signs of Upper Limiting

You might be upper limiting when:
- Things are going well, then suddenly go wrong
- You pick a fight for no reason
- You get sick or injured at key moments
- You make careless mistakes

### The Threshold

Notice your threshold:
- How much success can you tolerate?
- How much happiness feels "too much"?
- How much love before you push away?
- Where is your upper limit?

<Exercise title="Your Upper Limit">

Identify your upper limit patterns.

  prompt="Explore your upper limits:

GOOD THINGS GOING WRONG:
When have things been going well and then suddenly turned?

PATTERNS:
What happens when you exceed your comfort level of success/happiness/love?

YOUR THRESHOLD:
Where do you notice your upper limit?

THE MECHANISM:
How do you typically bring yourself back down?

## Secondary Gains

### The Hidden Benefits

Sometimes sabotage continues because it provides:
- An excuse (I could have done it, but...)
- Sympathy from others
- Avoidance of responsibility
- Familiar identity
- Connection through shared struggle

### The Comfort Zone

Sabotage can keep you in:
- The known (even if painful)
- An identity you understand
- Relationships that depend on you struggling
- A version of yourself that feels safe

### The Question

What would you have to give up if you stopped sabotaging?

---

## Identifying Your Logic

### Key Questions

To find your sabotage logic, ask:
- What is this pattern protecting me from?
- What would be threatening about succeeding?
- What do I believe about my worthiness?
- What familiar state does sabotage return me to?
- What do I get to avoid by failing?

### The Insight

When you find the logic:
- The pattern makes sense
- Self-compassion becomes possible
- You can address the real issue
- Change becomes possible

## Key Concepts

- **Protective function:** Self-sabotage usually aims to protect from something
- **Fear of success:** Sometimes we sabotage to avoid success, not failure
- **Unworthiness:** Deep beliefs about not deserving drive sabotage
- **Upper limits:** We have thresholds for how much good we can tolerate
- **Secondary gains:** Sabotage often provides hidden benefits
- **The logic:** There's always a reason, even if it's outdated
- **The insight:** Understanding the logic enables change

<Callout type="important">
Your self-sabotage is not random or crazy. It's following a logic—one that's usually trying to protect you from something. Maybe it's protecting you from failure, or from success. Maybe it's keeping you at a level of worthiness you believe you deserve. Maybe it's providing benefits you don't consciously recognize. When you understand the logic, you stop fighting blindly and start addressing what's really going on.
