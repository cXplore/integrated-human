## The Patterns

Self-sabotage shows up in recognizable patterns. Understanding these patterns helps you catch them earlier and respond differently. You might recognize yourself in several of these—most people have multiple sabotage patterns that activate in different contexts.

---

## Pattern 1: Procrastination

### How It Works

- Putting off important tasks
- Waiting until the last minute
- Doing everything except what matters
- Chronic delay despite consequences

### The Logic

Procrastination often:
- Protects from fear of failure
- Provides an excuse ("I would have done better with more time")
- Maintains potential (if you never finish, you never fail)
- Avoids the discomfort of effort

### The Result

Eventually:
- Rushed, subpar work
- Missed opportunities
- Increased stress
- Confirmation of inability

## Pattern 2: Self-Medication

### How It Works

Using substances or behaviors to:
- Numb uncomfortable feelings
- Escape from stress or pressure
- Avoid dealing with problems
- Create temporary relief

### Common Forms

- Alcohol or drugs
- Food (overeating, emotional eating)
- Shopping
- Social media/screen time
- Overworking

### The Logic

Self-medication:
- Provides immediate relief
- Avoids difficult emotions
- Creates predictable escape
- Feels like self-care (but isn't)

### The Result

The pattern creates:
- Health consequences
- Financial problems
- Relationship damage
- Worsening of the underlying issue

---

## Pattern 3: Relationship Sabotage

### How It Works

- Pushing partners away
- Picking fights for no reason
- Choosing unavailable people
- Finding fatal flaws in good relationships
- Cheating or creating conflict

### The Logic

Relationship sabotage:
- Protects from intimacy vulnerability
- Avoids potential rejection (you reject first)
- Confirms beliefs about being unlovable
- Keeps control in your hands

### The Result

A history of:
- Failed relationships
- Confirmed fears of abandonment
- Loneliness despite wanting connection
- Belief that "relationships just don't work for me"

## Pattern 4: Almost Success

### How It Works

- Getting close to goals, then stopping
- Sabotaging right before the finish line
- Nearly completing things but not quite
- Chronic "almost" but never "done"

### The Logic

Almost-success:
- Maintains potential without the risk of full success
- Avoids the pressure of having achieved
- Protects from raised expectations
- Keeps options open (theoretically)

### The Result

A life of:
- Unfinished projects
- Unrealized potential
- "What if" wondering
- Never quite arriving

---

## Pattern 5: Perfectionism as Sabotage

### How It Works

- Setting impossible standards
- Never finishing because it's not perfect
- Redoing work endlessly
- All-or-nothing thinking

### The Logic

Perfectionism:
- Provides an excuse for not finishing
- Protects from judgment ("If it's perfect, no one can criticize")
- Maintains impossibly high self-standards
- Creates an unwinnable game

### The Result

- Paralysis
- Burnout
- Rarely completed work
- Chronic dissatisfaction

## Pattern 6: Overcommitment

### How It Works

- Saying yes to everything
- Taking on too much
- Spreading yourself too thin
- Making it impossible to succeed

### The Logic

Overcommitment:
- Provides an excuse ("I had too much going on")
- Feels productive (even when it's not)
- Avoids having to prioritize (everything is "important")
- Protects from truly investing in one thing

### The Result

- Burnout
- Everything done poorly
- No real achievement
- Constant overwhelm

---

## Pattern 7: Playing Small

### How It Works

- Staying in your comfort zone
- Not taking opportunities
- Hiding your gifts
- Shrinking to avoid attention

### The Logic

Playing small:
- Protects from visibility and judgment
- Avoids outgrowing your identity or relationships
- Keeps expectations manageable
- Feels safe (but isn't fulfilling)

### The Result

- Unused potential
- Chronic frustration
- Settling for less
- Living someone else's small version of your life

<Callout type="important">
Recognizing your patterns is powerful. When you can name what's happening, you can catch it earlier. You can pause before the pattern completes. And you can make a different choice. The patterns aren't you—they're strategies. And strategies can be changed.
</Callout>

*Name the pattern, catch it early, choose differently.*
