## Confidence with Others

Many people who feel confident in some areas struggle in social situations. Social confidence—being at ease with others, speaking up, navigating relationships—is its own domain. This module addresses the unique challenges of confidence in interpersonal contexts.

---

## The Social Confidence Challenge

### Why Social Situations Are Hard

Social situations trigger insecurity because:
- Fear of judgment
- Risk of rejection
- Visibility and exposure
- Comparison to others
- Unpredictability

### Common Social Fears

People fear:
- Being judged negatively
- Saying the wrong thing
- Being rejected
- Looking foolish
- Not belonging
- Being seen as incompetent

### The Cost

Low social confidence costs:
- Missed connections
- Held-back contributions
- Career limitations
- Isolation
- Unfulfilled potential

## Shifting Perspective

### The Spotlight Effect

We overestimate how much others:
- Notice us
- Judge us
- Remember our mistakes
- Think about us at all

Reality: Others are mostly thinking about themselves.

### From Self-Focus to Other-Focus

The shift:
- Stop focusing on how you're coming across
- Start focusing on the other person
- Curiosity about them reduces self-consciousness
- Connection replaces performance

### Everyone Is Insecure

The truth:
- Most people feel insecure
- They're worried about themselves
- They want connection too
- You're not uniquely flawed

---

- Finding your people
- Knowing you can't please everyone
- Valuing self-assessment over others'
- Acting despite fear of judgment

<Callout type="important">
Social confidence is a skill, not a fixed trait. Through shifting perspective, building conversation skills, speaking up, handling judgment, and practicing assertiveness, you can become more at ease with others. Remember: most people are focused on themselves, not judging you. Focus on them, not on how you're coming across, and social confidence becomes much more accessible.
</Callout>

*Confidence with others comes from focusing on them, not yourself.*
