## Mapping Your Confidence

Confidence isn't uniform across all areas of life. You may feel confident in some domains and insecure in others. Understanding your unique confidence profile—where you're strong, where you struggle, and what patterns drive your experience—helps target your development work.

---

## Confidence Across Domains

### Different Domains

Confidence varies across areas:
- **Professional:** Work and career
- **Social:** Relationships and interactions
- **Intellectual:** Learning and thinking
- **Physical:** Body and appearance
- **Creative:** Expression and creation
- **Emotional:** Handling feelings
- **Identity:** Who you are fundamentally

### Domain Independence

Key insight:
- High confidence in one area doesn't guarantee it in others
- Many successful people lack social confidence
- Many socially confident people doubt their abilities
- You likely have a unique pattern

### Your Profile Matters

Understanding your profile:
- Shows where to focus
- Reveals patterns
- Identifies strengths to leverage
- Highlights growth areas
