## The External Foundation

While self-worth provides the internal foundation, competence provides the external one. Competence is real capability—skills, knowledge, and track record that ground your confidence in reality. This module focuses on developing genuine competence to support authentic confidence.

---

## What Competence Is

### Definition

Competence is:
- Actual ability to do something
- Skill developed through practice
- Knowledge acquired through learning
- Track record of handling situations
- Real capability, not just belief

### Why It Matters

Competence matters because:
- It grounds confidence in reality
- It provides evidence for self-trust
- It enables actual performance
- It reduces anxiety through preparation
- It creates real basis for confidence

### Competence vs. Self-Worth

Both are needed:
- **Self-worth:** "I'm valuable regardless of ability"
- **Competence:** "I actually can do this"
- Self-worth without competence is ungrounded
- Competence without self-worth is fragile
- Together they create stable confidence

## The Competence-Confidence Loop

### How It Works

The positive loop:
1. Take action →
2. Build skill →
3. See evidence of capability →
4. Confidence grows →
5. Take more action →
6. Continue building

### The Negative Loop

The negative version:
1. Avoid action →
2. Skills don't develop →
3. No evidence of capability →
4. Confidence stays low →
5. Continue avoiding →
6. Stuck

### Breaking In

To break into positive loop:
- Take action despite uncertainty
- Build skill through practice
- Notice and internalize evidence
- Let confidence grow from evidence
- Use confidence to take more action

## Skill Development

### How Skills Develop

Skills develop through:
- Practice and repetition
- Deliberate improvement
- Feedback and adjustment
- Challenge and stretch
- Time and persistence

### The Learning Curve

Expect:
- Initial incompetence (normal)

- Mastery takes time
- Progress isn't linear

### Choosing What to Develop

Focus on skills that:
- Matter for your goals
- Address confidence gaps
- Build on strengths
- Are achievable with effort
- Will make real difference

## Creating Evidence

### Building a Track Record

Evidence comes from:
- Actually doing things

- Reflecting on what you've handled
- Crediting yourself appropriately
- Letting evidence in

## Stretching Your Capacity

### Growth Through Challenge

Competence grows through:
- Challenges that stretch you

- Expands what's possible

### Not Too Much, Not Too Little

Balance:
- Too easy: No growth
- Too hard: Overwhelm and defeat
- Just right: Stretch that builds

Shift toward growth by:
- Believing you can improve

## Key Concepts

- **Competence:** Real capability—skills, knowledge, track record
- **Both pillars needed:** Self-worth + competence = stable confidence
- **Competence-confidence loop:** Action → skill → evidence → confidence → more action
- **Skill development:** Practice, feedback, time, persistence
- **Knowledge building:** Study, training, experience, reflection
- **Evidence:** Notice and internalize achievements and capabilities
- **Preparation:** Reduces uncertainty and builds readiness
- **Stretch challenges:** Growth comes from just-beyond-current-ability challenges
- **Growth mindset:** Belief that ability can develop through effort

---

<Callout type="important">
Competence grounds confidence in reality. While self-worth provides the internal foundation, competence provides evidence that you actually can do what you need to do. Build real skills, acquire genuine knowledge, take on challenges, and create evidence of your capability. This isn't about being perfect—it's about being genuinely capable in the areas that matter to you.
</Callout>

*Confidence without competence is hollow. Build the real thing.*
