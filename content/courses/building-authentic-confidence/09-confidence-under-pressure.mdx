## When Stakes Are High

Confidence is easy when nothing's on the line. The real test is maintaining confidence under pressure—in high-stakes situations, during challenges, when failure matters. This module addresses confidence when it counts most.

---

## Why Pressure Challenges Confidence

### What Pressure Does

Pressure activates:
- Fight-or-flight response
- Self-doubt
- Negative self-talk
- Fear of failure
- Performance anxiety

### Common Pressure Situations

High-pressure moments:
- Important presentations
- Job interviews
- Critical conversations
- Public performances
- High-stakes decisions
- Being evaluated

### The Paradox

The paradox:
- When confidence matters most
- It's often hardest to access
- Pressure undermines what you need
- But it doesn't have to

## Managing the Nervous System

### Pressure and Physiology

Under pressure:
- Heart rate increases
- Breathing becomes shallow
- Muscles tense
- Adrenaline releases
- Brain goes into survival mode

### Regulating the Response

Manage physiology through:
- Slow, deep breathing
- Muscle relaxation
- Grounding in body
- Movement before
- Calming rituals

### Channeling Arousal

Reframe activation:
- Excitement, not just fear
- Energy, not just nerves
- Readiness, not just anxiety
- Arousal as preparation

## Preparation as Confidence

### Preparation Reduces Uncertainty

Preparation helps by:
- Increasing readiness
- Reducing surprises
- Building competence
- Creating evidence of effort
- Providing backup

### Types of Preparation

Prepare through:
- Knowledge and research
- Practice and rehearsal
- Scenario planning
- Backup plans
- Mental preparation

### Not Over-Preparing

Balance:
- Enough preparation to be ready
- Not so much it becomes avoidance
- At some point, you must act
- Perfect preparation doesn't exist

## Staying Present Under Pressure

### The Problem of Distraction

Under pressure we get distracted by:
- Fear of failure
- Self-consciousness
- Past failures
- Future worries
- How we're being perceived

### Presence Is Power

Staying present helps by:
- Focusing on task, not fear
- Using all capacity for performance
- Not wasting energy on worry
- Enabling flow state

### Presence Techniques

Stay present through:
- Focus on the task at hand
- Use senses to anchor
- Breathe and body awareness
- Narrow attention to now
- Let go of outcome attachment

---

<Exercise title="Staying Present">

Develop your presence skills.

## Recovering from Setbacks

### Setbacks Will Happen

Accept that:
- Things won't always go well
- Mistakes will occur
- Confidence can dip
- Recovery is key

### In-the-Moment Recovery

When things go wrong during:
- Don't catastrophize
- Refocus on next moment
- Let go of what happened
- Continue with what remains
- Trust your recovery

### Post-Situation Recovery

After setbacks:
- Process emotions
- Extract learning
- Don't over-generalize
- Rebuild for next time
- Be compassionate with yourself

---

<Exercise title="Recovery Plan">

## Building Pressure Tolerance

### Exposure Builds Tolerance

Pressure tolerance grows through:
- Repeated exposure
- Surviving high-pressure moments
- Accumulating evidence
- Building familiarity

### Gradual Exposure

Build tolerance through:
- Starting with lower stakes
- Gradually increasing pressure
- Practicing in safe settings
- Simulating high-pressure
- Building up to real situations

### Learning from Experience

Each experience teaches:
- What works under pressure
- What doesn't
- Your actual capacity
- How to improve

---

<Exercise title="Building Tolerance">

Plan pressure tolerance building.

<Journal
  id="cup-tolerance"

## Key Concepts

- **Pressure challenge:** Stakes activate fight-or-flight and self-doubt
- **Physiological management:** Breathing, relaxation, channeling arousal
- **Preparation:** Reduces uncertainty; creates readiness
- **Mental preparation:** Visualization, self-talk, pre-performance routine
- **Staying present:** Focus on task, not fear or perception
- **Recovery:** In-the-moment refocusing and post-situation processing
- **Tolerance building:** Exposure and practice increase capacity
- **The paradox addressed:** With practice, confidence can be maintained when it matters most

---

<Callout type="important">
Confidence under pressure isn't about eliminating nervousness—it's about performing well despite it. Through physiological management, thorough preparation, mental readiness, presence skills, and recovery strategies, you can maintain confidence when stakes are high. And the more you expose yourself to pressure, the more tolerance you build. The confident performer isn't fearless—they're skilled at performing with fear.

*True confidence shows up when it matters most.*
