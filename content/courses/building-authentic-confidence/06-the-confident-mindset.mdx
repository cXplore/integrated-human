## The Mental Game

Confidence isn't just about worth and competence—it's also about how you think. Your thought patterns either support or undermine confidence. This module develops the mental habits and perspectives that sustain authentic confidence.

---

## How Thoughts Affect Confidence

### The Thought-Feeling Connection

Thoughts drive feelings:
- Negative thoughts → low confidence
- Supportive thoughts → higher confidence
- Interpretation matters more than events
- You can influence your thinking

### Automatic Thoughts

Much thinking is automatic:
- Happens without intention
- Often negative by default
- Rooted in old patterns
- Can be noticed and changed

### The Power of Mindset

Mindset affects everything:
- How you interpret events
- What you believe is possible
- How you respond to setbacks
- What actions you take

---

<Exercise title="Your Thought Patterns">

## Cognitive Distortions

### Common Distortions

These thinking errors undermine confidence:

**All-or-Nothing:** Everything is success or failure
**Catastrophizing:** Worst-case is assumed
**Mind-Reading:** Assuming others think poorly of you
**Fortune-Telling:** Predicting negative outcomes
**Discounting Positives:** Dismissing good things
**Should Statements:** Harsh demands on self
**Personalization:** Taking everything personally
**Labeling:** "I'm a failure" vs. "I failed at this"

### Recognizing Distortions

Notice when you:
- Think in extremes
- Predict disaster
- Assume the worst
- Dismiss evidence
- Attack yourself

### Correcting Distortions

Counter distortions by:
- Naming the distortion
- Questioning the thought
- Finding more balanced view
- Looking for evidence
- Reframing

---

<Exercise title="Your Distortions">

## Reframing

### What Reframing Is

Reframing means:
- Changing how you interpret something
- Finding alternative perspectives
- Shifting from negative to balanced
- Not denial—more accurate thinking

### Reframing Techniques

Approaches:
- "What else could this mean?"
- "What would I tell a friend?"
- "What's the most balanced view?"
- "What's the evidence for and against?"
- "How will this look in a year?"

### From Threat to Opportunity

Common reframes:
- Failure → Learning opportunity
- Criticism → Information
- Challenge → Growth
- Uncertainty → Possibility
- Setback → Data point

---

<Exercise title="Reframing Practice">

Practice reframing.

<Journal
  id="tcm-reframe"
  prompt="Practice reframing:

Think of a situation that undermines your confidence:

THE SITUATION:

CURRENT INTERPRETATION:
How do you currently think about it?

ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS:
What else could it mean?

MORE BALANCED VIEW:
What's a more balanced perspective?

NEW FRAME:
How can you think about this differently?"

## Self-Talk

### Your Inner Dialogue

You talk to yourself constantly:
- Running commentary
- Evaluation of yourself
- Predictions and interpretations
- This dialogue shapes confidence

### Negative Self-Talk

Confidence-killing self-talk:
- "I can't do this"
- "I'm going to fail"
- "They won't like me"
- "I'm not good enough"
- "Who am I to try this?"

### Confident Self-Talk

Confidence-supporting self-talk:
- "I can handle this"
- "I'm prepared and capable"
- "I'll do my best"
- "I can learn from whatever happens"
- "I'm worthy regardless of outcome"

---

<Exercise title="Transforming Self-Talk">

## Focus and Attention

### What You Focus On Matters

Focus determines experience:
- Focus on threats → anxiety
- Focus on failures → low confidence
- Focus on capability → confidence
- Focus on learning → growth

### Redirecting Attention

Shift focus to:
- What you can do (not can't)
- Past successes (not just failures)
- What you're learning (not just outcomes)
- Your strengths (not just weaknesses)
- Present moment (not feared future)

### Selective Attention

Practice noticing:
- Evidence of competence
- Times you handled things well
- Progress and improvement
- Positive feedback
- Your capabilities

---

<Exercise title="Attention Practice">

Practice redirecting attention.

<Journal
  id="tcm-focus"
  prompt="Practice attention direction:

DEFAULT FOCUS:
Where does your attention naturally go?

WHAT YOU MISS:
What positive things do you not notice?

REDIRECT:
What should you focus on more?

EVIDENCE SCAN:
What evidence of your competence have you missed?

PRACTICE:
How will you practice redirecting attention?"

## Confidence Before vs. During vs. After

### Before: Anticipation

Before challenges:
- Anticipatory anxiety is normal
- Prepare, don't catastrophize
- Remind yourself of capability
- Accept uncertainty
- Commit to acting anyway

### During: Presence

During challenges:
- Stay present (not in feared future)
- Focus on task, not on how you're doing
- Trust your preparation
- Handle what arises
- Let performance emerge

### After: Learning

After challenges:
- Assess accurately (not harshly)
- Note what worked
- Identify improvement areas
- Credit yourself appropriately
- Extract learning

<Exercise title="Before, During, After">

Develop mindset for each phase.

<Journal
  id="tcm-phases"
  prompt="Develop mindset for each phase:

BEFORE (anticipation):

DURING (action):

## Handling Failure

### Failure Is Inevitable

Accept that:
- Everyone fails sometimes
- Failure doesn't define you
- It's information, not verdict
- Successful people fail often

### Confident Response to Failure

When you fail:
- Don't catastrophize
- Separate failure from worth
- Extract the learning
- Adjust approach
- Try again

### Failure as Teacher

Reframe failure as:
- Data about what doesn't work
- Opportunity to improve
- Normal part of growth
- Evidence of trying
- Teacher, not enemy

---

<Exercise title="Your Failure Response">

Develop your failure response.

<Journal
  id="tcm-failure"
  prompt="Develop your failure response:

CURRENT RESPONSE:
How do you currently respond to failure?

CONFIDENT RESPONSE:

<Callout type="important">
Your thoughts shape your confidence. The good news is that thoughts can be changed. By catching distortions, reframing interpretations, shifting self-talk, and directing attention, you can develop mental habits that support rather than undermine your confidence. This isn't positive thinking that ignores reality—it's accurate thinking that acknowledges your capability.
</Callout>

*Think confidently. Not because it's positive, but because it's accurate.*
