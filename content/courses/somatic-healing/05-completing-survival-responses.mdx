## Incomplete Responses

When threat happens, the body responds—fight, flight, or freeze. These are survival responses, automatic and protective.

But sometimes the response doesn't complete. You couldn't run. You couldn't fight. You froze and stayed frozen.

**The incomplete response remains in the body, waiting to finish.**

---

## Understanding Survival Responses

### Fight:
- Mobilization to confront threat
- Muscles tense for action
- Energy rises
- Impulse to push, hit, defend

### Flight:
- Mobilization to escape threat
- Legs ready to run
- Energy for speed
- Impulse to flee

### Freeze:
- Immobilization when fight/flight impossible
- Body locks, numbs
- Dissociation
- Playing dead

### Fawn:
- Social strategy for threat
- Appease the threat
- Make yourself safe by compliance
- Common in relational trauma

---

## Why Responses Don't Complete

### External Reasons:
- Couldn't fight (too small, too weak)
- Couldn't run (trapped, held)
- Had to freeze to survive
- Had to fawn to stay safe

### Internal Reasons:
- Suppressed the impulse
- Told to "be good"
- Shame about the response
- Never had permission to complete

### The Result:
The response stays in the nervous system. The body is still trying to fight that fight, run that run, unfreeze from that freeze.

## Signs of Incomplete Fight

### In the Body:
- Chronic tension in arms, shoulders, jaw
- Hands in fists
- Teeth grinding
- Upper body armoring

### In Life:
- Difficulty with anger
- Either explosive or suppressed
- Feeling powerless
- Difficulty asserting boundaries

### The Incomplete Impulse:
The body still wants to push, hit, defend—but the movement never happened.

---

## Signs of Incomplete Flight

### In the Body:
- Tension in legs, feet
- Restless leg syndrome
- Can't be still
- Chronic running (literally or figuratively)

### In Life:
- Always wanting to escape
- Difficulty committing, staying
- Avoidance patterns
- Leaving before being left

### The Incomplete Impulse:
The body still wants to run—the escape that never happened.

---

## Signs of Incomplete Freeze

### In the Body:
- Chronic numbness
- Feeling paralyzed
- Low energy, collapsed
- Disconnection from body

### In Life:
- Difficulty taking action
- Feeling stuck
- Shutdown in stress
- Dissociation patterns

### The Incomplete State:
The body is still frozen—never fully came back to life after the freeze.

## Completing Fight Responses

### The Principle:
Allow the body to make the movements it wanted to make, slowly and safely.

### Techniques:

**Pushing:**
- Push against a wall or cushion
- Feel the strength in your arms
- Let sound come if it wants
- Push until the impulse completes

**Striking:**
- Hit a cushion or mattress
- Use words if they come
- Let the energy move through arms
- Continue until completion

**Micro-Movements:**
- Make tiny pushing or fighting movements
- Just enough to feel the impulse
- Let the nervous system register completion
- Sometimes less is more

---

<Exercise title="Completing Fight">

Try pushing against a wall. Press with your hands, arms, whole body. Feel your strength. What happens?

<Journal
  id="completing-fight"
  prompt="What happened when you pushed? What sensations arose? Any emotions? Words? What shifted?"
  placeholder="What I noticed when pushing:&#10;&#10;Sensations:&#10;&#10;Emotions or words:&#10;&#10;What shifted:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Completing Flight Responses

### The Principle:
Let the legs do what they wanted to do—run, kick, move.

### Techniques:

**Running in Place:**
- Lie down, run your legs in the air
- Or stand and run in place
- Let the running complete
- Feel the escape happening

**Kicking:**
- Lie down and kick
- Kick a mattress or cushion
- Let the energy move through
- Feel the power in legs

**Walking Away:**
- Symbolically walk away from a situation
- Feel yourself leaving
- Notice the body's response
- Complete the escape

---

<Exercise title="Completing Flight">

Lie down and let your legs "run" or kick. Let them move as they want. What happens?

<Journal
  id="completing-flight"
  prompt="What happened when you let your legs move? What sensations? Emotions? What did your body want to do?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;What my body wanted to do:&#10;&#10;What completed:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Coming Out of Freeze

### The Principle:
Freeze is a shutdown—coming out requires gentle reactivation, not force.

### Techniques:

**Gentle Movement:**
- Small movements first
- Fingers, toes, eyes
- Gradually larger
- Don't rush

**Orienting:**
- Slowly look around the room
- Notice you're here, now
- Feel the present safety
- Come back to now

**Shaking:**
- Allow trembling if it comes
- This is freeze discharging
- Don't suppress it
- Let it complete

**Warmth:**
- Blankets, warm drinks
- Comfort and safety
- The body thaws
- Give it time

---

<Exercise title="Coming Out of Freeze">

Notice if any part of you feels frozen, numb, or shut down. Bring gentle attention there. What does it need?

<Journal
  id="coming-out-freeze"
  prompt="Where do you feel freeze or numbness? What happens when you bring gentle attention? What does that part need to thaw?"
  placeholder="Where I feel frozen or numb:&#10;&#10;What happens with attention:&#10;&#10;What this part needs:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Importance of Titration

### Remember:
Complete survival responses gradually, not all at once.

### Too Much, Too Fast:
- Can retraumatize
- Can overwhelm
- Misses the point

### Just Enough:
- Small movements
- Brief contact with the impulse
- Return to resource
- Repeat over time

### The Body Leads:
Let the body show you what it needs, at the pace it can handle.

---

## Working with Fight/Flight Energy

### When Energy Rises:
- Let it move
- Don't suppress
- Find safe outlet
- Movement, sound, breath

### Signs of Discharge:
- Trembling, shaking
- Temperature changes
- Breath changes
- Emotional release

### After Discharge:
- Rest
- Feel the completion
- Notice what's different
- Integrate before continuing

---

## Micro-Movements

### Sometimes Less Is More:
- Tiny movements can complete patterns
- The nervous system registers completion
- Less is often enough
- Don't need catharsis

### Examples:
- Slight pushing motion with hands
- Minimal running motion with legs
- Tiny turning away gesture
- Almost imperceptible reaching

### The Key:
Awareness + micro-movement = nervous system completion.

---

<Exercise title="Micro-Movement Practice">

Choose a movement impulse (push, run, turn away). Make the smallest possible version of that movement while feeling it fully.

<Journal
  id="micro-movement"
  prompt="What micro-movement did you try? What did you notice? What shifted with minimal movement?"
  placeholder="Micro-movement I tried:&#10;&#10;What I noticed:&#10;&#10;What shifted:"
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

## Working with Memory

### Caution:
Working directly with traumatic memory requires professional support.

### For Self-Practice:
- Work with body sensation, not memory content
- Let the body process without needing the story
- If memory comes, don't dive in—stay with body
- Get support for significant trauma

### The Body Knows:
Even without accessing memory, the body can complete. The completion is physical, not cognitive.

---

## Signs of Completion

### You'll Notice:
- Breath changes (often deepens, sighs)
- Muscles relax
- Temperature shifts
- Emotional release (tears, anger, relief)
- Sense of settlement
- Something "clicks" or resolves
- The impulse no longer feels stuck

### After Completion:
- Rest is essential
- Integration takes time
- You may feel different
- Don't rush to next thing

---

<Exercise title="Your Completion Work">

<Journal
  id="completion-work"
  prompt="What survival responses most need completion in you? How will you work with them? What support do you need?"
  placeholder="What most needs completion:&#10;&#10;How I'll work with it:&#10;&#10;Support I need:&#10;&#10;My approach:"

## Building Healthy Responses

### After Completing Old Patterns:
The nervous system can now respond freshly instead of replaying the past.

### New Capacities:
- Healthy aggression (fight) for boundaries
- Healthy escape (flight) when needed
- Coming out of freeze more easily
- Wider range of responses

### Integration:
Old responses completing → nervous system updating → new possibilities.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Incomplete Responses:** Fight, flight, or freeze that didn't complete stay stuck.

- **Completion:** Letting the body make the movements it couldn't make.

- **Titration:** Small amounts, gradual process.

- **The Body Leads:** Follow the body's impulses at its pace.

- **After Completion:** Rest, integration, new possibilities.

## What's Next

In Module 6, you'll learn about restoring natural flow—building ongoing practices for somatic health.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify your dominant survival patterns
- Try gentle completion work
- Notice what shifts

---

*The body has been trying to complete that response for years—maybe decades. The fight you couldn't fight. The escape you couldn't make. The freeze you never came out of. These aren't stuck forever. When you give the body permission and conditions, it will finish what it started. And in that completion, something finally resolves.*
