## The Flowing Body

When the body is healthy, energy flows. Breath moves freely. Tension arises and releases naturally. Emotions come, are felt, and pass.

This is the natural state—not rigid, not collapsed, but alive and moving.

**The goal of somatic work isn't a "fixed" body—it's a flowing one.**

---

## From Healing to Maintenance

### The Shift:
- Early work: Releasing stored material
- Ongoing work: Maintaining flow, preventing buildup

### The Difference:
Healing work addresses what's accumulated. Maintenance prevents new accumulation.

### Both Are Needed:
Clear the backlog AND build practices to stay clear.

---

## Daily Somatic Hygiene

### Just Like Physical Hygiene:
You brush your teeth daily. You shower. You attend to the body.

### Somatic Hygiene:
- Daily attention to body state
- Regular release practices
- Preventing tension buildup
- Emotional processing in real time

### The Minimum:
- Body scan morning or evening
- Shake or move when tension noticed
- Process emotions as they arise
- Don't let things accumulate

## Morning Practice

### Starting the Day Embodied:

**Option 1 - Minimal (5 min):**
- Body scan in bed
- Stretch/shake
- Breathe consciously
- Set embodied intention

**Option 2 - Moderate (15 min):**
- Body scan
- Movement practice (yoga, shaking, spontaneous)
- Breath work
- Grounding practice

**Option 3 - Full (30+ min):**
- All of above
- Plus meditation
- Plus longer movement
- Deep resourcing

### Choose What's Sustainable:
Better 5 minutes daily than 30 minutes occasionally.

---

## Evening Practice

### Completing the Day:

**Release What Accumulated:**
- What tension built today?
- What emotions weren't fully felt?
- What's still lingering?

**Simple Evening Practice:**
- Body scan
- Notice what's still held
- Breathe into tension areas
- Shake or move if needed
- Conscious transition to rest

### Not Carrying Today into Sleep:
Process what can be processed. Let the day complete.

## In-the-Moment Practices

### When Tension Arises:
Don't wait. Address it now.

**Quick Release:**
- Notice the tension
- Breathe into it
- Shake or move
- Let it go before it sets

**Micro-Breaks:**
- Every hour, check in with body
- Notice, breathe, adjust
- Prevent buildup
- Takes 30 seconds

### The Key:
Real-time processing prevents accumulation.

---

## Processing Emotions Somatically

### Feel in the Body:
- Where is the emotion in your body?
- What does it feel like?
- Can you stay with it?
- Let it complete

### The Complete Cycle:
1. Emotion arises
2. Felt in the body
3. Allowed without suppression
4. Completes and passes
5. Body returns to neutral

### What Blocks This:
- Suppression
- Distraction
- Intellectualization
- Rushing

### Healthy Flow:
Emotions come, are felt, and go. Nothing sticks.

## Movement as Medicine

### Regular Movement:
- Bodies are meant to move
- Movement prevents stagnation
- Find movement you enjoy
- Consistency over intensity

### Types That Help:

**Structured:**
- Yoga, tai chi, qigong
- Conscious movement practices
- Martial arts
- Dance classes

**Unstructured:**
- Free movement to music
- Play
- Walking in nature
- Following body impulse

### The Body Needs Both:
Exercise AND rest. Movement AND stillness. Action AND recovery.

---

## Breath Practice

### Breath Is Always Available:
- No equipment needed
- Can practice anywhere
- Immediate effect
- Cumulative benefit

### Simple Daily Breath Practice:

**Morning:**
Energizing breath (faster, fuller)

**Throughout Day:**
Conscious breaths at transitions

**Evening:**
Calming breath (slow exhale, extended)

**When Stressed:**
Slow, deep breaths to regulate

## Professional Support

### When to Seek It:
- Significant trauma history
- Difficulty doing work alone
- Hitting stuck places
- Wanting to go deeper
- When things get intense

### Types of Support:

**Somatic Experiencing:**
Trauma resolution through body

**EMDR:**
Trauma processing with bilateral stimulation

**Bodywork:**
Massage, craniosacral, Rolfing

**Somatic Therapy:**
Various body-based therapeutic approaches

### Combination:
Self-practice + professional support often works best.

---

## The Regulated Nervous System

### Signs of Regulation:
- Can feel without overwhelm
- Can calm after activation
- Flexible responses
- Wide window of tolerance

### Building Regulation:
- Co-regulation with safe others
- Self-regulation practices
- Healing stuck patterns
- Time and consistency

### This Is the Goal:
Not a body that never activates, but one that can activate AND return to calm.

## Building Body Trust

### The Goal:
A body you trust and that trusts you.

- Honoring needs
- Not overriding
- Keeping commitments to body

---

## Lifestyle Factors

### Sleep:
- The body heals in sleep
- Prioritize quality rest
- Address sleep issues

### Nutrition:
- Bodies need fuel
- Notice how foods affect you
- Nourish rather than punish

### Stress:
- Chronic stress keeps body activated
- Address sources when possible
- Build stress resilience

### Connection:
- Co-regulation matters
- Safe relationships help
- Isolation is hard on bodies

---

## Creating Your Personal Practice

### Components to Include:
- Daily body awareness
- Regular movement
- Breath practice
- Emotional processing
- Release techniques
- Rest and recovery

### Customize:
- What works for YOUR body
- What's sustainable
- What you'll actually do
- Adjust as needed

### Evolution:
Your practice will change over time. What you need now isn't what you'll need later.

- **Daily Hygiene:** Regular attention prevents buildup.

- **In-the-Moment Processing:** Address tension and emotion as they arise.

- **Professional Support:** Some work needs guidance.

- **Regulated Nervous System:** Can activate and return to calm.

## Course Completion

You've completed the Somatic Healing course.

**Where to go from here:**
- Implement daily practices
- Work with the exercises over time
- Seek professional support if needed
- Trust the body's wisdom

---

*The body has always been trying to heal. The tension, the symptoms, the stuck places—they're not failures. They're the body's best attempts to survive what happened. Now you know how to work with the body instead of against it. How to listen, how to release, how to complete. The body has been waiting for this partnership. And now, together, you can restore what was always meant to be—a body that flows, feels, and is fully alive.*
