## The Foundation

Sleep hygiene isn't about cleanliness. It's about habits and environment that support good sleep.

These are the basics—the foundation that makes everything else work. Get these right, and sleep improves. Skip these, and no amount of supplements or tricks will help.

## The Cardinal Rules

### 1. Consistent Wake Time

**The most important rule.**

Wake at the same time every day—including weekends.

Why it matters:
- Anchors your circadian rhythm
- Builds consistent sleep pressure
- Makes falling asleep easier
- Creates predictability for your body

Sleeping in on weekends feels good but creates "social jet lag"—shifting your rhythm and making Monday miserable.

**What to do:**
- Set a fixed wake time
- Stick to it 7 days a week
- Use an alarm if needed
- Don't snooze

### 2. Consistent Bed Time

Less critical than wake time, but helpful:
- Creates a routine
- Ensures adequate sleep opportunity
- Signals to body that sleep is coming

**What to do:**
- Set target bed time
- Allow enough time for desired sleep
- Stick within 30 minutes most nights

### 3. Bed for Sleep Only

Your brain is associative. If you use bed for:
- Work
- Scrolling phone
- Watching TV
- Worrying

Then your brain associates bed with wakefulness.

**What to do:**
- Bed is for sleep (and sex) only
- If you can't sleep after 20 minutes, get up
- Return when sleepy
- Do worrying, planning, screens elsewhere

### 4. Get Morning Light

Light in the first hour after waking:
- Resets circadian rhythm
- Suppresses melatonin
- Increases morning alertness
- Improves nighttime sleep

**What to do:**
- Get outside within 30-60 minutes of waking
- Even 10-15 minutes helps
- Cloudy is okay (still much brighter than indoor)
- Use light therapy box if necessary

## Pre-Sleep Routine

### The Wind-Down

Your body needs transition time:
- 30-60 minutes minimum before bed
- Calm, relaxing activities
- Dim lighting
- Signal to body that sleep is coming

**What works:**
- Reading (not on bright screen)
- Gentle stretching
- Journaling
- Relaxation exercises
- Bath or shower
- Quiet conversation

**What doesn't work:**
- Work
- Email
- News
- Social media
- Stressful content
- Bright lights
- Exercise (too late)

### The Wind-Down Routine

Create a consistent sequence:
1. Set a "power down" time (e.g., 9pm)
2. Do wind-down activities in same order
3. Dim lights
4. Prepare for next day (so mind isn't planning)
5. Relaxation practice
6. Get into bed

Consistency creates automatic transition.

## Sleep Environment

### Darkness

Make bedroom as dark as possible:
- Blackout curtains
- Cover LED lights (tape, remove devices)
- No phone screen
- Eye mask if necessary

Even small amounts of light affect melatonin and sleep quality.

### Temperature

Cool room for sleep:
- 60-67°F (15-19°C) ideal for most
- Experiment to find your preference
- Layer bedding so you can adjust
- Warm socks okay (warm extremities help sleep)

### Noise

Minimize or mask noise:
- Earplugs
- White noise machine
- Fan
- Close windows
- Communicate with household members

Consistency of sound matters more than silence.

### Comfort

Basic but important:
- Good mattress (invest if you can)
- Comfortable pillow
- Appropriate bedding
- Address physical comfort issues

You spend a third of your life in bed. It matters.

## Daytime Habits That Affect Night

### Exercise

Exercise improves sleep:
- Increases deep sleep
- Reduces time to fall asleep
- Improves overall quality

**Timing:**
- Morning or afternoon best
- Evening exercise may delay sleep (individual variation)
- At least 4-6 hours before bed for intense exercise

### Caffeine

Cut off time:
- 10-12 hours before bed for sensitive individuals
- At least 8 hours for most
- Some need to eliminate entirely

### Meals

Eating pattern:
- Regular meals (supports circadian rhythm)
- Finish eating 2-3 hours before bed
- Light snack okay if hungry

### Naps

If you nap:
- Keep it 20-30 minutes max
- Early afternoon only (before 3pm)
- Longer naps reduce sleep pressure

If you have insomnia, avoid naps entirely.

## Implementing Changes

### Start with the Basics

Priority order:
1. Consistent wake time (most important)
2. Morning light
3. Bedroom environment (darkness, temperature)
4. Evening screen/light reduction
5. Wind-down routine
6. Caffeine/alcohol adjustments

### One at a Time

Don't change everything at once:
- Pick one or two things
- Implement for a week
- Add more changes
- Build gradually

### Give It Time

Sleep improvements take time:
- 2-4 weeks to see full effects
- Circadian rhythm adjusts slowly
- Be patient

### Track What Works

Notice what helps:
- Simple sleep diary
- Rate sleep quality
- Note what you did or didn't do
- Find patterns

## Key Concepts

- **Consistent wake time:** The most important rule
- **Bed for sleep only:** Train the brain to associate bed with sleep
- **Morning light:** Reset circadian rhythm daily
- **Wind-down routine:** 30-60 minutes of calm before bed
- **Environment:** Dark, cool, quiet, comfortable
- **Daytime habits:** Exercise, caffeine timing, meal timing, naps

<Callout type="important">
Sleep hygiene is the foundation, but it's not a cure for all sleep problems. If you have a sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, etc.), professional treatment may be needed. But even with disorders, good sleep hygiene makes everything else work better.

*Sleep hygiene is simple. Not always easy—but simple. Build the foundation.*
