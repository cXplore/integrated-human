## The Enemies of Sleep

Modern life is a sleep-disruption machine.

Understanding what disrupts sleep is essential for knowing what to change. Here are the major sleep enemies—and how to combat them.

---

## Light

### The Problem

Light is the primary circadian signal. When light enters your eyes:
- Brain registers "day"
- Melatonin is suppressed
- Alertness increases
- Circadian rhythm shifts

Blue light (from screens, LED lights) is particularly potent.

### Evening Light

Bright light in evening:
- Delays melatonin release
- Pushes your circadian rhythm later
- Makes it harder to fall asleep
- Reduces sleep quality

### Morning Light

Lack of light in morning:
- Fails to reset circadian rhythm
- Leaves you groggy
- Makes it harder to wake up
- Shifts rhythm later over time

### Solutions

**Evening:**
- Dim lights after sunset
- Use warm-toned bulbs
- Reduce screen use (or use blue light filters/glasses)
- Wear blue light blocking glasses if watching screens
- Avoid bright bathroom lights before bed

**Morning:**
- Get bright light early (ideally natural sunlight)
- Use a light therapy box if needed
- Open curtains immediately
- Morning outdoor time

## Caffeine

### The Problem

Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors:
- Masks sleep pressure
- Doesn't eliminate it—just delays
- Has a long half-life (5-6 hours)
- Quarter-life even longer
- Reduces deep sleep even when you can fall asleep

### Hidden Caffeine

Sources beyond coffee:
- Tea (including green)
- Energy drinks
- Cola
- Chocolate
- Some medications
- Some supplements

### Individual Variation

Caffeine metabolism varies:
- Some metabolize quickly (fast acetylators)
- Some slowly (caffeine affects them more, longer)
- Genetics play a role

### Solutions

- No caffeine after noon (or earlier for slow metabolizers)
- Consider 8-10 hour caffeine-free window before bed
- Reduce total intake if sleep is suffering
- Be aware of hidden sources
- Consider cycling off periodically to reset tolerance

---

## Alcohol

### The Problem

Alcohol is deeply disruptive to sleep:
- May help falling asleep (sedation, not sleep)
- Suppresses REM sleep severely
- Causes fragmented second half of night
- Increases awakenings
- Worsens sleep apnea
- Causes dehydration

The sedating effect fools people into thinking it helps.

### Solutions

- Limit alcohol, especially close to bedtime
- Allow 3+ hours between last drink and sleep
- Stay hydrated
- Recognize alcohol's true effect on sleep

Even moderate drinking affects sleep quality.

---

## Stress and Anxiety

### The Problem

Stress is a major sleep enemy:
- Keeps you in sympathetic (fight-or-flight) mode
- Racing thoughts at bedtime
- Cortisol stays elevated
- Difficult to fall asleep
- Light, fragmented sleep
- Early waking

### The Worry Loop

In bed:
1. Think about stressor
2. Feel anxious
3. Can't sleep
4. Worry about not sleeping
5. More anxious
6. Less able to sleep

### Solutions

- Stress management practices during day
- "Worry time" earlier in day (scheduled worrying)
- Brain dump before bed (write out concerns)
- Relaxation techniques (breathing, progressive muscle relaxation)
- Cognitive techniques for racing thoughts
- Therapy if anxiety is significant
- Keep notepad by bed for nighttime thoughts

---

## Screen Use

### The Problem

Screens before bed:
- Emit blue light (melatonin suppression)
- Often have stimulating content
- Keep the mind active
- Associated with delayed sleep onset

### It's Not Just Blue Light

Content matters too:
- News, social media, email = stress and arousal
- Gaming = high stimulation
- Even relaxing content on screen = blue light

### Solutions

- No screens 30-60+ minutes before bed
- If you must use screens: blue light filters, night mode, blue light glasses
- No phone in bedroom (or use airplane mode)
- Create screen-free wind-down routine
- Charge devices outside bedroom

---

## Temperature

### The Problem

Your body needs to cool down for sleep:
- Core temperature drops 1-2°F during sleep
- This drop triggers sleep onset
- Too-warm room prevents this
- Hot sleeping = poor quality sleep

### Solutions

- Cool bedroom (60-67°F / 15-19°C is ideal for most)
- Light bedding, not too heavy
- Cool shower before bed (paradoxically cools you down after)
- Temperature-regulating sleepwear and bedding
- Adjust for personal preference

---

## Eating and Drinking

### The Problem

**Eating late:**
- Digestion interferes with sleep
- Can cause reflux when lying down
- Raises core temperature

**Large meals:**
- Particularly disruptive
- Require more digestive effort

**Fluids:**
- Lead to nighttime urination
- Disrupt sleep for bathroom trips

### Solutions

- Finish eating 2-3 hours before bed
- Light snack okay if needed (not heavy meal)
- Reduce fluids 1-2 hours before bed
- Limit alcohol (also a diuretic)

---

## Noise

### The Problem

Noise disrupts sleep even when you don't fully wake:
- Causes arousals (partial wakings)
- Shifts you to lighter sleep
- Prevents deep sleep
- Can cause full awakenings

### Solutions

- Earplugs (soft foam or silicone)
- White noise machine or app
- Fan for consistent background sound
- Address noise sources where possible
- Bedroom away from street noise if possible

<Exercise title="Identify Your Disruptors">

Map the sleep disruptors in your life.

### Part 1: Disruptor Inventory

<Checklist
  id="disrupt-inventory"
  items={[
    "Bright light in evening (screens, bright house lights)",
    "Screen use close to bedtime",
    "Caffeine after noon",
    "Alcohol (especially close to bedtime)",
    "Stress and racing thoughts at night",
    "Eating too close to bed",
    "Bedroom too warm",
    "Noise disruptions",
    "Inconsistent schedule",
    "Phone in bedroom"
  ]}
/>

### Part 2: Your Personal Disruptors

<Journal

• What are your top 3 sleep disruptors?
• How significant is each one?
• Which are you willing to change?
• Which will be hardest to change?"

### Part 3: Action Plan

<Journal

  prompt="Create an action plan:

For your top disruptors, what specifically will you change?

## Cumulative Effect

### It Adds Up

Individual disruptors combine:
- Caffeine + stress + screens = much worse than any alone
- The more disruptors, the worse the effect
- Removing one helps, but addressing multiple helps more

### Priority Order

Some disruptors matter more:
1. Inconsistent schedule (very impactful)
2. Light exposure (evening and morning)
3. Caffeine timing
4. Alcohol
5. Stress management
6. Environment (temp, noise)

Start with the big ones.

## Key Concepts

- **Light:** Evening light delays sleep; morning light anchors rhythm
- **Caffeine:** Blocks adenosine, long half-life, affects deep sleep
- **Alcohol:** Severely disrupts REM and second half of night
- **Stress:** Keeps you in fight-or-flight, racing thoughts
- **Screens:** Blue light + stimulating content
- **Temperature:** Cool room supports sleep
- **Eating:** Finish eating 2-3 hours before bed
- **Noise:** Disrupts even when you don't fully wake

<Callout type="important">
Addressing disruptors is often more effective than adding sleep aids. Before reaching for supplements or medications, optimize your sleep environment and habits.
