## Beyond the Basics

Sleep hygiene is the foundation. Once that's solid, advanced strategies can further optimize sleep quality.

These are evidence-based approaches for those who want to go deeper.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)

### The Gold Standard

CBT-I is the most effective treatment for chronic insomnia:
- More effective than sleeping pills long-term
- No side effects
- Benefits persist after treatment
- Recommended as first-line treatment

### Core Components

**Sleep restriction:**
- Temporarily limit time in bed
- Matches time in bed to actual sleep time
- Builds sleep pressure
- Consolidates sleep
- Gradually expand as efficiency improves

**Stimulus control:**
- Bed for sleep only
- Get up if not sleeping
- Return when sleepy
- Breaks association between bed and wakefulness

**Cognitive restructuring:**
- Identify unhelpful thoughts about sleep
- Challenge catastrophic thinking
- Reduce anxiety about sleep
- Develop realistic expectations

**Relaxation training:**
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Breathing techniques
- Reduce physiological arousal

### How to Access

- Therapist trained in CBT-I
- Structured programs (e.g., VA CBT-I coach app)
- Online programs (some evidence-based)
- Books (e.g., "Say Good Night to Insomnia" by Gregg Jacobs)

## Sleep Tracking

### What to Track

Basic tracking:
- Bedtime and wake time
- How long to fall asleep
- Wake periods during night
- How you feel in morning

Advanced tracking (wearables):
- Estimated time in stages
- Heart rate variability
- Movement patterns
- Trends over time

### Useful vs. Obsessive

Sleep tracking can help:
- Identify patterns
- See effects of changes
- Motivate consistency

But it can also:
- Create anxiety about numbers
- Become obsessive
- Disrupt sleep (orthosomnia—worrying about data)

Use tracking as a tool, not an obsession.

### Wearable Options

- Oura Ring
- Whoop
- Fitbit
- Apple Watch
- Garmin

Accuracy varies. Trends are more useful than absolute numbers.

## Circadian Optimization

### Light as Medicine

Strategic light exposure:
- Bright light (10,000 lux) for 20-30 minutes in morning
- Especially helpful in winter or if you wake late
- Light therapy boxes for those lacking natural light
- Helps with seasonal depression too

### If You're a Night Owl

Delayed sleep phase:
- Natural tendency to sleep late, wake late
- Can be shifted earlier with:
  - Morning bright light
  - Evening light avoidance
  - Consistent earlier wake time (gradual shift)
  - Sometimes melatonin (evening, low dose—consult provider)

### If You're an Early Bird

Advanced sleep phase:
- Natural tendency to sleep early, wake early
- If too extreme:
  - Evening light exposure
  - Morning light avoidance
  - Gradual shift later

### Shift Work

Shift work disrupts circadian rhythm:
- Bright light during night shift
- Dark glasses on commute home
- Black-out conditions for day sleep
- Melatonin before day sleep (consult provider)
- Challenging long-term; minimize if possible

---

## Supplements

### Melatonin

- Hormone, not a sleeping pill
- Signals timing, not sedation
- Best for jet lag, shift work, circadian issues
- Low dose (0.5-1mg) often more effective than high dose
- Take 30-60 minutes before desired sleep
- Extended release for staying asleep
- Not regulated well in US (actual content varies)

### Magnesium

- Many people are deficient
- May help with sleep (especially glycinate form)
- Supports relaxation and muscle function
- Generally safe in reasonable doses
- 200-400mg glycinate or threonate before bed

### Other Supplements

Evidence varies:
- **L-theanine:** Amino acid, promotes relaxation
- **Glycine:** May lower body temperature, improve quality
- **Valerian:** Mixed evidence
- **CBD:** Early research, effects vary

Start with sleep hygiene before supplements.

## Sleep Hacks

### Temperature Manipulation

Body temperature drops for sleep. You can accelerate this:
- Warm bath/shower 1-2 hours before bed
- Body heats up, then rapidly cools after
- This cooling triggers sleep onset
- "Warm socks" method—warm feet, cool core

### Breathing Techniques

Specific practices for sleep onset:
- 4-7-8 breathing
- Extended exhale (4 in, 6-8 out)
- Coherent breathing
- Progressive muscle relaxation with breath

### Mental Techniques

For racing mind:
- Cognitive shuffle (random, unrelated images)
- Body scan meditation
- Counting backwards from 300 by 3s
- Gratitude practice
- "Brain dump" journal before bed

### Sleep Stories and Audio

- Sleep stories (Calm, Headspace, etc.)
- Non-engaging audio (rain, white noise)
- Boring podcasts
- Guide attention away from thoughts

### Part 2: CBT-I Relevance

<Journal
  id="advanced-cbti"
  prompt="Consider if CBT-I might help:

• Do you struggle with chronic insomnia?
• Do you lie in bed awake often?
• Is anxiety about sleep part of the problem?
• Would structured approach help?
• How might you access CBT-I resources?"

<Journal
  id="advanced-circadian"
  prompt="Assess your circadian rhythm:

• Are you naturally early bird or night owl?
• Is this working for your life?

## When to Seek Help

### See a Provider If

- Sleep problems persist despite good sleep hygiene
- Loud snoring or gasping (possible sleep apnea)
- Persistent daytime sleepiness
- Restless legs or unusual movements
- Significant insomnia affecting function
- Sleep problems after trauma

### Sleep Disorders

Conditions requiring professional evaluation:
- Sleep apnea
- Chronic insomnia
- Restless leg syndrome
- Narcolepsy
- Parasomnias (sleepwalking, etc.)
- Circadian rhythm disorders

Sleep study may be indicated.

## Key Concepts

- **CBT-I:** Gold standard for insomnia, more effective than pills
- **Circadian optimization:** Strategic light exposure for timing
- **Supplements:** Melatonin for timing, magnesium commonly helpful
- **Temperature manipulation:** Warm bath/shower triggers cooling
- **Mental techniques:** Manage racing mind at bedtime
- **When to seek help:** Persistent issues, snoring/apnea, disorders

<Callout type="important">
Advanced strategies build on basics—they don't replace them. If you haven't fully implemented sleep hygiene, start there. And if problems persist, seek professional evaluation rather than endlessly experimenting on your own.
