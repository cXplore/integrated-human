## The Practice That Sticks

Many people try meditation but can't sustain it. They practice for days or weeks, then stop. This module is about building a practice that lasts—not through willpower, but through intelligent setup, realistic expectations, and understanding what actually makes practice sustainable.

---

## Why Practice Fails

### Common Reasons

Practice typically fails because:
- Unrealistic expectations (peace immediately)
- Starting too ambitiously (30 minutes right away)
- No consistent time or place
- Judging sessions as "good" or "bad"
- Expecting linear progress
- Waiting for motivation

### The Deeper Issue

The real problem is often:
- Not understanding what practice is
- Seeking a certain experience
- Fighting the mind instead of working with it
- No structure to support habit
- Giving up when it's hard

### What Works

Sustainable practice requires:
- Realistic understanding
- Minimal viable practice
- Consistent routine
- Non-judgmental approach
- Long-term view

## The Minimum Viable Practice

### Start Smaller Than You Think

The key to building habit:
- Start ridiculously small
- 5 minutes is enough to start
- Even 2 minutes counts
- Build consistency first
- Increase duration later

### Why Small Works

Small practice works because:
- It's impossible to say "I don't have time"
- It reduces resistance
- It builds the habit loop
- Success builds on success
- Consistency matters more than duration

### Progression

After habit is established:
- Gradually increase
- 5 minutes → 10 → 15 → 20
- Take weeks or months per increase
- Never increase so much you stop
- Better shorter and consistent than longer and sporadic

## Setting Up Practice

### When to Practice

Choose a consistent time:
- Morning (before day takes over)
- Evening (transition from day)
- Same time daily
- Attached to existing habit
- Protected from interruption

### Where to Practice

Create a practice space:
- Same place helps cue habit
- Relatively quiet
- Comfortable seating
- Minimal distractions
- Doesn't need to be special

### What You Need

Minimal equipment:
- Somewhere to sit (cushion, chair, bench)
- Timer (phone is fine)
- Comfortable clothing
- Nothing else required

## Sitting Positions

### The Principles

Good posture:
- Spine naturally upright (not rigid)
- Body stable and grounded
- Comfortable enough to be still
- Alert, not sleepy
- Sustainable for session length

### Common Positions

**On a cushion (cross-legged):**
- Hips higher than knees
- Various leg positions (cross-legged, Burmese, half-lotus)
- Cushion elevates hips
- Traditional and stable

**On a chair:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Not leaning back
- Hands on thighs or in lap
- Perfectly valid option

**Kneeling (seiza):**
- On bench or cushion
- Between heels or on top
- Good for those who can't cross legs

### Finding Your Position

Experiment:
- Try different positions
- What's sustainable for you?
- Pain isn't necessary
- Adjustments are allowed
- Comfort enables concentration

## What to Do in Practice

### Basic Instructions

Simple beginning practice:

1. **Settle in:** Arrive in your body, feel seated
2. **Set intention:** Why are you here?
3. **Choose anchor:** Usually breath
4. **Rest attention:** On chosen anchor
5. **Notice wandering:** When mind wanders, notice
6. **Return gently:** No judgment, come back
7. **Repeat:** This IS the practice
8. **End consciously:** Don't just jump up

### The Core Loop

The practice is essentially:
1. Anchor attention
2. Mind wanders (this will happen)
3. Notice wandering
4. Return to anchor
5. Repeat indefinitely

This simple loop IS meditation.

<Exercise title="First Formal Practice">

Do a short formal practice.

<Journal
  id="fop-first"
  prompt="Practice for 5 minutes using basic instructions:

1. Sit comfortably, spine upright
2. Close eyes or soften gaze
3. Feel your body sitting
4. Notice your breath
5. When mind wanders, return to breath
6. Do this for 5 minutes

After practice:

• What did you notice?
• How many times did your mind wander?
• What was returning like?
• What was challenging?
• What was easy?"

## Working With Resistance

### Resistance Is Normal

You will face resistance:
- "I don't feel like it today"
- "I'm too busy right now"
- "I'll do it later"
- "This isn't working anyway"
- Mind generating excuses

### Understanding Resistance

Resistance comes from:
- Mind preferring familiar
- Avoiding discomfort of sitting with yourself
- Not seeing immediate payoff
- Conditioning to activity
- Normal human psychology

### Working With It

Handle resistance by:
- Expecting it (not surprised)
- Doing it anyway (action before motivation)
- Making it non-negotiable
- Sitting even when you don't want to
- Remembering that resistance is temporary

---

## Expectations and Progress

### What to Expect

Realistic expectations:
- Mind will wander—constantly at first
- Some sits feel good, many don't
- Progress is non-linear
- Some days are harder than others
- Benefits emerge over weeks and months

### Progress Markers

Signs of progress (subtle):
- Noticing distraction faster
- Less caught in thought trains
- Moments of presence in daily life
- Slightly more equanimity
- Growing capacity to be with discomfort

### The Long View

Remember:
- This is practice, not performance
- You're building capacity over time
- Consistency matters more than any single session
- Benefits accrue gradually
- Trust the process

<Exercise title="Your Expectations">

Clarify your expectations.

<Journal

  prompt="Examine your expectations:

• What do you expect from meditation?
• Are these expectations realistic?
• What would you like to experience?
• What progress would look like for you?
• How will you handle sessions that feel 'bad'?"

Are these realistic:

## Building the Habit

### Habit Formation Principles

Habits form through:
- **Cue:** What triggers the behavior
- **Routine:** The behavior itself
- **Reward:** What reinforces it

For meditation:
- Cue: Same time/place or after existing habit
- Routine: The meditation itself
- Reward: How you feel after, sense of accomplishment

### Practical Strategies

Build the habit:
- Same time every day
- Same place
- Start immediately small
- Never miss twice
- Track your practice

### When You Miss

If you miss:
- Don't catastrophize
- Return next day
- Never miss twice
- Shorter session counts
- Consistency over perfection

---

## Your First Week

### The Assignment

For your first week:
- Practice 5 minutes daily
- Same time each day
- Same place
- Use basic breath meditation
- Don't judge sessions
- Just show up

### What to Track

Notice:
- Did you practice?
- What time?
- How did it go?
- What arose?
- What did you learn?

### No Pressure

Remember:
- 5 minutes is enough
- There's no way to fail
- Every sit counts
- You're building foundation
- Start where you are

<Exercise title="Your Practice Commitment">

• How many minutes will you start with?
• What will you do when you don't feel like it?

## Common Questions

### "What if I fall asleep?"

Options:
- Try a different time of day
- Sit rather than lie down
- Practice when more alert
- Eyes open slightly
- Some sleepiness is normal initially

### "How do I know if I'm doing it right?"

If you're:
- Sitting down
- Trying to pay attention
- Noticing when you're distracted
- Returning to anchor

You're doing it right. That's all there is.

### "My mind won't stop thinking"

That's normal:
- Thoughts are not the problem
- Noticing them is the practice
- Every wandering is chance to return
- No one has an empty mind
- You're doing fine

---

## Key Concepts

- **Minimum viable practice:** Start with 5 minutes—consistency over duration
- **Setup matters:** Same time, same place, minimal friction
- **Posture:** Upright, stable, comfortable, alert
- **Basic loop:** Anchor, notice wandering, return, repeat
- **Resistance:** Normal—practice anyway
- **Expectations:** Mind will wander; progress is gradual and non-linear
- **Habit:** Same time, same place, never miss twice
- **First week:** 5 minutes daily, no judgment

---

<Callout type="important">
The biggest obstacle to meditation practice isn't difficulty—it's inconsistency. A mediocre 5-minute daily practice beats an excellent 30-minute practice you do twice a week. Build the habit first. Duration and depth can grow from a consistent foundation.
