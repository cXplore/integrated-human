## Coming Home to the Body

The body is always in the present moment. While the mind travels to past and future, the body is always here, always now. Body-based meditation uses this anchor to develop presence, ground awareness, and connect you to embodied experience. This module develops somatic meditation skills.

---

## Why Body-Based Practice

### The Body Is Always Present

Unlike mind, which wanders:
- The body is always here
- It exists only in present
- Sensations are happening now
- Can't think your way into a sensation
- Body anchors you to this moment

### Benefits

Body-based practice:
- Grounds scattered attention
- Connects mind and body
- Develops interoception (inner sensing)
- Releases stored tension
- Integrates dissociated parts

### Complementing Breath

Body practice complements breath:
- Broader than breath alone
- Includes more sensation
- Good for those who struggle with breath
- Develops different capacity
- More embodied presence

## Body Scan Meditation

### What It Is

Body scan:
- Systematically moving attention through body
- Noticing sensations in each area
- With curiosity and acceptance
- Neither changing nor judging
- Just knowing what's there

### Basic Body Scan

Instructions:

1. **Settle:** Lie down or sit comfortably
2. **Start at feet:** Bring attention to feet
3. **Notice sensations:** Temperature, pressure, tingling, contact
4. **Move slowly:** Feet → legs → pelvis → belly → chest → back → arms → hands → neck → head
5. **Equal attention:** Spend equal time on each area
6. **If nothing:** Note neutral or no sensation
7. **If wandering:** Return to body part
8. **Whole body:** End with sense of whole body breathing

### Timing

Body scan can be:
- 10 minutes (quick scan)
- 20-30 minutes (full scan)
- 45 minutes (deep practice)

Adjust to available time.

<Exercise title="Body Scan Practice">

Practice a full body scan.

<Journal
  id="bbp-scan"
  prompt="Do a 15-minute body scan, moving from feet to head.

After practice:

• What sensations did you notice?
• Which areas were easy to feel?
• Which areas were hard to feel?
• Did you discover any surprises?
• What was the overall experience?"

## Types of Body Sensations

### What You Might Notice

Sensations include:
- **Temperature:** Warm, cool, hot, cold
- **Pressure:** Heaviness, lightness
- **Contact:** Clothing, chair, floor
- **Texture:** Smooth, rough, tight
- **Movement:** Pulsing, throbbing, vibrating
- **Pain:** Sharp, dull, aching
- **Pleasure:** Pleasant sensations
- **Neutral:** No particular sensation

### Developing Sensitivity

With practice:
- Subtler sensations become available
- Areas once "blank" come alive
- Greater detail emerges
- Body becomes more knowable
- Sensitivity increases

### Accepting All

All sensations are valid:
- Pleasant, unpleasant, neutral
- Strong or subtle
- Obvious or barely there
- All are practice material
- No hierarchy

---

## Whole Body Awareness

### Beyond Parts

Another practice—whole body:
- Instead of scanning parts
- Feel the whole body at once
- Entire body as sensation field
- Breathing body
- Body as one process

### How to Practice

Whole body awareness:
1. Settle in
2. Feel body as a whole
3. Sense the entire field of sensation
4. Body breathing as one organism
5. Stay with whole-body sense
6. When wandering, return to whole body

### When to Use

Useful for:
- When scanning feels tedious
- Developing spacious awareness
- Integration after body scan
- General embodiment practice
- Different flavor of body meditation

<Exercise title="Whole Body Practice">

Practice whole body awareness.

<Journal
  id="bbp-whole"
  prompt="Practice 10 minutes of whole body awareness:

Feel the entire body at once, breathing as one organism.

• What was it like to feel the whole body?
• How did this differ from scanning parts?
• What quality of awareness did you notice?
• What was challenging?
• What was rewarding?"

## Working With Tension

### Finding Tension

The body holds tension:
- Jaw, face, shoulders
- Neck, upper back
- Belly, pelvic floor
- Anywhere habitual
- Often unconscious

### Softening Practice

When you find tension:
- Notice it with curiosity
- Don't force release
- Breathe into the area
- Invite softening
- Accept if it stays

### Why We Hold

Tension exists because:
- Chronic stress patterns
- Emotional holding
- Postural habits
- Protection
- Unconscious gripping

Body scan reveals these patterns.

---

<Exercise title="Finding Your Tension">

Map your tension patterns.

<Journal
  id="bbp-tension"
  prompt="Scan your body for areas of holding or tension:

• Where do you find tension in your body right now?
• What happens when you breathe into these areas?
• Do any areas resist releasing?
• What patterns do you notice?
• What might your body be holding?"

## Sitting With Sensations

### The Practice

Beyond scanning—sitting with:
- Choose a sensation
- Stay with it continuously
- Watch it closely
- Notice how it changes
- Develop intimacy with sensation

### What You Learn

Sitting with sensation shows:
- Sensations constantly change
- They're not solid
- Attention affects perception
- Relationship matters
- Nothing stays the same

### Working With Discomfort

With uncomfortable sensation:
- Approach with curiosity
- Don't immediately avoid
- Study the sensation closely
- Breathe with it
- See what happens

(Note: Don't override genuine pain signals)

---

<Exercise title="Sitting With Sensation">

Practice sustained attention on one sensation.

<Journal
  id="bbp-sitting"
  prompt="Choose one sensation in your body and stay with it for 5 minutes:

• What sensation did you choose?
• What happened as you stayed with it?
• Did it change?
• What did you discover?
• What was challenging about sustained attention?"

## Movement and Stillness

### Still Practice

Most meditation is still:
- Body unmoving
- Attention inward
- Stability supports concentration
- Traditional approach

### Moving Practice

Movement can also be meditative:

- Tai chi, qigong
- Any movement with awareness
- Body moving, mind present

### Integrating Both

Complete practice includes:
- Still meditation
- Mindful movement
- Everyday movement with awareness
- Transitions between movement and stillness
- Body as ongoing meditation

Walking meditation:
1. Find a path (10-30 steps)
2. Stand and feel body

6. Stay with sensations of walking
7. Return when mind wanders

### What to Notice

In walking meditation:
- Weight shifting
- Muscles engaging

- Contact with ground
- Balance
- Whole body walking

### Speed

Different speeds:
- Very slow: Detail-rich, concentration

<Callout type="important">
The body is not just a vehicle for the mind—it's an intelligence in itself. Body-based meditation reconnects you to this intelligence, grounds you in the present, and develops awareness that's embodied rather than just mental. Come home to your body.
