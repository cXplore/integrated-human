## The Basics First

Before learning special techniques, you need functional breathing—natural, healthy patterns for everyday life.

Many adults have lost functional breathing. The goal is to restore it: nose breathing, diaphragmatic, light, slow.

## The Four Pillars of Functional Breathing

### 1. Nose Breathing

The nose is designed for breathing. It:
- Filters particles and pathogens
- Humidifies the air
- Warms the air to body temperature
- Produces nitric oxide (helps oxygen absorption)
- Provides appropriate resistance
- Signals safety to the nervous system

Mouth breathing bypasses all of this.

**Practice:**
- Notice when you're mouth breathing
- Gently close lips
- Breathe through nose during daily activities
- Tape mouth gently at night (if no breathing disorders—see a doctor first if unsure)

### 2. Diaphragmatic Breathing

The diaphragm is the primary breathing muscle. When it works properly:
- Belly expands on inhale
- Chest remains relatively still
- Breathing is effortless
- Full oxygenation occurs

Chest breathing is compensatory—for emergencies, not rest.

**Practice:**
- Place one hand on chest, one on belly
- Breathe so belly hand moves, chest hand stays relatively still
- Imagine breathing into your lower back
- Don't force—gentle expansion

### 3. Light Breathing

Many people overbreathe. Light breathing means:
- Taking only the breath you need
- No excess volume
- Comfortable, barely noticeable
- Not trying to breathe deeply all the time

This maintains proper CO2 levels and reduces hyperventilation symptoms.

**Practice:**
- Reduce breath volume slightly (10-20%)
- Tolerate slight air hunger
- Keep breathing smooth and easy
- Don't strain

### 4. Slow Breathing

Slower breathing is generally healthier:
- 4-6 breaths per minute is optimal for relaxation
- Even 8-10 is better than 15-20
- Slow breathing increases vagal tone
- It improves heart rate variability

**Practice:**
- Gradually lengthen inhale and exhale
- Work toward 4-6 breaths per minute
- Keep it comfortable—don't force
- Use counting to pace

## Restoring Nasal Breathing

### The Challenge

If you're a chronic mouth breather:
- Nose may feel congested
- Nasal breathing feels insufficient
- Habit is deeply ingrained

### Making the Switch

**During the day:**
- Conscious attention to keeping mouth closed
- Reminder notes or phone alerts
- Tape on lip (awareness, not force)
- Address congestion (see below)

**During exercise:**
- Start with low intensity, nose only
- Build tolerance gradually
- Accept that it's harder at first
- Your capacity will increase

**During sleep:**
- Mouth tape (micropore tape, specific products)
- Start with short periods
- Ensure no obstructions before taping
- Consult doctor if you have sleep apnea or other conditions

### Reducing Congestion

If your nose is blocked:
- Humming increases nitric oxide and opens passages
- Gentle breathwork (below) can help
- Address allergies if relevant
- Consider nasal rinse (neti pot)
- See ENT if severe obstruction

### Buteyko Clearing Exercise

1. Breathe normally, then exhale gently
2. Hold nose and nod head or walk until moderate air hunger
3. Release and breathe gently through nose
4. Wait a minute, repeat 3-6 times

This can temporarily clear the nose.

## Diaphragmatic Breathing Training

### Basic Practice

Lying down:
1. Bend knees, feet flat
2. One hand on chest, one on belly
3. Breathe in through nose—belly rises, chest stays still
4. Exhale—belly falls
5. Practice 5-10 minutes

### Seated Practice

Sitting upright:
1. Same hand placement
2. Inhale—belly expands forward
3. Exhale—belly draws back
4. Shoulders and chest stay relaxed

### Why It's Hard

Chest breathing becomes habitual from:
- Stress (fight-or-flight activates chest muscles)
- Sitting (compresses diaphragm)
- Tight clothing
- Sucking in stomach (social pressure)
- Anxiety

Reversing this takes consistent practice.

---

## Light, Slow Breathing

### The Cadence

Work toward:
- Inhale: 4-5 seconds
- Exhale: 4-6 seconds
- No pause, or gentle natural pause
- 5-6 breaths per minute

This is called coherent or resonant breathing.

### Practice

1. Find comfortable seated position
2. Breathe through nose into belly
3. Inhale for 5 seconds
4. Exhale for 5 seconds
5. Continue for 5-10 minutes
6. Use a timer or guided audio

Start with what's comfortable. Build toward longer breaths gradually.

### Signs You're Overbreathing

- Frequent sighing
- Frequent yawning
- Taking occasional big breaths
- Feeling you can't get enough air
- Symptoms: dizziness, anxiety, tingling

If these are present, work on lighter breathing.

<Exercise title="Functional Breathing Practice">

Practice and assess functional breathing.

### Part 1: Nose Breathing Check

For the next 24 hours, notice your breathing:

<Checklist
  id="functional-nose"
  items={[
    "Morning check: Was I mouth breathing on waking?",
    "During work/tasks: Am I breathing through my nose?",
    "During conversation: Do I breathe through my mouth?",
    "During exercise: Can I nose breathe at low intensity?",
    "Evening check: How much nose breathing today?"
  ]}
/>

<Journal
  id="functional-nose-reflect"
  prompt="What did you notice about your nose vs. mouth breathing patterns?"
  placeholder="I noticed:..."
  rows={4}
/>

### Part 2: Diaphragmatic Practice

Practice diaphragmatic breathing for 5 minutes now:

<Journal
  id="functional-diaphragm"
  prompt="After practicing, note:

• Could you keep chest still while belly moved?
• Where did you feel tension or difficulty?
• Did it become easier over the 5 minutes?
• How did you feel afterward?"
  placeholder="Chest still, belly moving:

Tension/difficulty:

Did it get easier:

How I felt after:..."
  rows={10}
/>

### Part 3: Slow Breathing

Try 5 minutes of coherent breathing:
- Inhale 5 seconds
- Exhale 5 seconds
- Through nose
- Into belly

<Journal
  id="functional-slow"
  prompt="After slow breathing practice:

• Could you maintain the pace?
• Did it feel comfortable or strained?
• What did you notice about your state?
• How many breaths per minute felt right for you?"
  placeholder="Maintaining the pace:

Comfortable or strained:

My state:

Comfortable breaths per minute:..."
  rows={10}
/>

### Part 4: Integration Plan

<Journal
  id="functional-plan"
  prompt="Plan for integrating functional breathing:

• What's your biggest breathing issue? (Mouth, chest, fast, etc.)
• What will you work on first?
• When will you practice?
• How will you remember during the day?"
  placeholder="Biggest issue:

First priority:

When I'll practice:

How I'll remember:..."
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## Daily Integration

### Throughout the Day

- Morning: Check breathing upon waking
- Work: Periodic nose-breathing checks
- Stress: Return to slow, nasal, belly breathing
- Exercise: Nose breathe at lower intensities
- Evening: Slow breathing before bed

### Practice Sessions

Even 5-10 minutes of deliberate practice helps:
- Morning practice
- During commute
- Work breaks
- Before bed

### Building the Habit

It takes time to change ingrained patterns:
- Weeks to establish new habits
- Months to fully automate
- Ongoing attention for maintenance

Be patient. The changes are worth it.

## Key Concepts

- **Four pillars:** Nose breathing, diaphragmatic, light, slow
- **Nose breathing:** The healthy default—filter, humidify, warm, nitric oxide
- **Diaphragmatic:** Belly moves, chest stays still
- **Light breathing:** Only what you need, not overbreathing
- **Slow breathing:** 4-6 breaths per minute optimal for relaxation
- **Daily integration:** Frequent checks and brief practices

<Callout type="important">
Changes to breathing should be gradual and comfortable. If practices cause distress, ease off. If you have respiratory conditions, work with healthcare providers on breathing changes.
