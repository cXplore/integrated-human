## Preparing the Mind

Physical preparation readies the vessel. Psychological preparation opens the door.

Your mindset going in profoundly shapes what emerges. This isn't about controlling the experience—it's about showing up ready.

**You can't dictate what happens. But you can prepare how you meet it.**

## Setting Intention

### What Intention Is:
- A genuine question you carry in
- An area of life you want illumination on
- A quality you want to cultivate
- A wound you want to work with

### What Intention Is Not:
- A demand for specific experiences
- A rigid agenda
- A guarantee of outcomes
- A shopping list for the medicine

### The Balance:
Hold intention like you'd hold a question in meditation—present but not gripping. You bring it to the experience and then let go.

<Journal
  id="exploring-intention"
  prompt="What are you genuinely curious about? What's alive in your life that you'd welcome insight on? What questions are you carrying? Don't try to be spiritual—be honest."
  placeholder="What I'm genuinely curious about:&#10;&#10;What's alive in my life:&#10;&#10;Questions I'm carrying:"

## Crafting Your Intention

### Good Intentions Sound Like:
- "I want to understand my relationship with my father"
- "I'd like insight into why I sabotage myself"
- "I want to feel my grief about..."
- "I want to connect with a sense of meaning"
- "I want to meet whatever needs to be met"

### Less Helpful Intentions:
- "I want to see geometric patterns" (too specific)
- "I want to feel amazing the whole time" (avoiding difficulty)
- "I want to fix my depression" (outcome-focused)
- "I want enlightenment" (grandiose)

### The Test:
Does your intention come from genuine seeking? Would you accept if the experience addressed it in unexpected ways?

---

<Exercise title="Your Intention">

<Journal
  id="your-intention"
  prompt="Write a clear intention for an experience. Keep it genuine, open-ended, and held lightly. You can have one primary intention or a few related ones."
  placeholder="My intention:&#10;&#10;Why this matters to me:&#10;&#10;I'm willing to receive insight on this in unexpected ways:"
  rows={6}
/>

## Examining Expectations

### Common Expectations:
- "It will be spiritual and beautiful"
- "I'll finally understand everything"
- "It will solve my problems"
- "I'm ready for whatever comes" (often not true)

### The Problem with Expectations:
- They set you up for disappointment
- They can cause fighting with actual experience
- They create a lens that distorts
- They're usually fantasies

### Better Approach:
Know that you don't know. Prepare for uncertainty. Expect the unexpected.

<Exercise title="Expectation Inventory">

<Journal
  id="expectation-inventory"
  prompt="What are you expecting from a psychedelic experience? What do you hope will happen? What are you afraid will happen? Get honest about your fantasies and fears."
  placeholder="What I expect/hope:&#10;&#10;What I'm afraid might happen:&#10;&#10;Fantasies I notice:&#10;&#10;Where I might be surprised:"
  rows={8}

## Working with Fear

### Fear Is Normal:
- These are powerful experiences
- The unknown is inherently scary
- Past experiences (or stories) may create fear
- Fear can be a sign of respect

### Types of Fear:
- Fear of losing control
- Fear of seeing something terrible
- Fear of death/ego death
- Fear of permanent damage
- Fear of not being able to handle it

### Working with Fear:
1. Acknowledge it (don't pretend it's not there)
2. Investigate it (what specifically?)
3. Dialogue with it (what does it need?)
4. Prepare for it (what will help?)
5. Proceed anyway (courage, not absence of fear)

<Exercise title="Your Fears">

<Journal
  id="fear-exploration"
  prompt="What fears do you have about psychedelic experiences? Be specific. What would help you meet these fears? What would you need to feel ready?"
  placeholder="My fears:&#10;&#10;Specific concerns:&#10;&#10;What would help me meet these:&#10;&#10;What I need to feel ready:"

## Psychological Contraindications

### Seriously Consider If:
- You're in acute mental health crisis
- You have current suicidal ideation
- You have untreated severe trauma
- You have psychotic history
- You have certain personality disorders
- You're using the experience to escape rather than face

### Questions to Ask:
- Am I stable enough for destabilization?
- Do I have support for what might surface?
- Is this the right time in my life?
- Am I running from something or toward something?

### If Uncertain:
- Consult with therapists familiar with psychedelics
- Be honest with facilitators
- Consider waiting
- Address acute issues first

---

## Developing Trust

Trust is essential for navigating the experience:

### Trust in the Process:
- Psychedelics tend to show what needs to be seen
- Difficult content is often exactly what needs attention
- The experience has its own intelligence
- You can work with whatever arises

### Trust in Yourself:
- You have more capacity than you think
- You can handle difficult material
- You've survived everything so far
- Inner resources are available

### Trust in Support:
- If you have sitters or facilitators
- The space has been prepared
- You're not alone
- Help is available if needed

---

<Exercise title="Building Trust">

<Journal
  id="building-trust"
  prompt="How much do you trust the process? Trust yourself? Trust your support? Where is trust lacking? What would build more trust?"
  placeholder="Trust in the process:&#10;&#10;Trust in myself:&#10;&#10;Trust in support:&#10;&#10;Where trust is lacking:&#10;&#10;What would build trust:"

## Mental Preparation Practices

### Before the Experience:
- Meditation (develops capacity to be with what is)
- Journaling (clarifies what's alive)
- Therapy (if in therapy, work on relevant material)
- Breath work (prepares for intense states)

### Specific Exercises:
- Visualize sitting with difficulty and breathing through
- Practice surrendering in meditation
- Work with acceptance: "I can be with this"
- Cultivate curiosity about the unknown

### The Week Before:
- Reduce mental stimulation
- Spend time in reflection
- Begin turning inward
- Notice what's arising naturally

---

## The Surrender Instruction

The core psychological preparation:

### Learn to Surrender:
This is different from giving up or being passive. It's active acceptance, moving toward rather than away.

### What Surrender Means:
- Letting go of control
- Not fighting what arises
- Trusting the process
- Allowing rather than resisting

### Practice Now:
In meditation, in life—when discomfort arises, practice:
- Breathing
- Relaxing the body
- Saying yes to the experience
- Moving toward, not away

**This is the skill you'll need most during the experience.**

<Exercise title="Surrender Practice">

<Journal
  id="surrender-practice"
  prompt="What's your relationship with surrender? Where do you struggle to let go? How might you practice surrender before an experience? What helps you release control?"

**Before moving on:**

*Psychological preparation isn't about having everything figured out. It's about being ready to meet the unknown. You prepare not by predicting what will happen, but by cultivating the capacity to be with whatever does.*
