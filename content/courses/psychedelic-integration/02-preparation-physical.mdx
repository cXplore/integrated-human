## Preparing the Body

Physical preparation often gets overlooked in favor of psychological preparation. But the body is where the experience happens.

**A well-prepared body supports smoother navigation and cleaner processing.**

---

## Why Physical Preparation Matters

### The Body Holds:
- Tension that blocks flow
- Emotions stored somatically
- Material that will surface
- The capacity to feel and process

### Physical Discomfort:
- Can distract from the work
- Can become amplified
- Can signal something needing attention
- Is easier when the body is prepared

### Cleaner Experience:
- Well-rested body processes better
- Clean diet reduces noise
- Physical health supports integration

---

## Timeline: Weeks Before

### Start Cleaning Up:
- Reduce or eliminate alcohol
- Reduce or eliminate cannabis
- Reduce processed foods
- Increase whole foods, vegetables
- Hydrate well

### Begin Body Practices:
- Movement: yoga, walking, exercise
- Stretching and releasing tension
- Breath work (gently)
- Adequate sleep

### Why the Lead Time:
- Physical changes take time
- You want a baseline of health
- Gradual transition is easier
- You're showing commitment to the process

## Medications and Contraindications

### Critical to Research:
Different psychedelics interact differently with medications

### Common Interactions:

### What to Do:
- Research your specific medications
- Consult knowledgeable practitioners
- Don't stop medications abruptly
- Be completely honest with any guides/facilitators

### Withdrawal Considerations:
If tapering off medications, do so:
- Under medical supervision
- With adequate time before experience
- Not rushed for a ceremony

## Sleep and Rest

### Before the Experience:
