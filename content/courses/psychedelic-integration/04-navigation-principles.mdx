## During the Experience

Preparation is complete. You've entered the experience. Now what?

Navigation isn't about controlling the experience—it's about relating to it skillfully. These principles help you work with whatever arises.

**The experience is the teacher. Your job is to be a good student.**

---

## The Core Principle: Surrender

### The Single Most Important Instruction:
Let go. Breathe. Trust.

### When Facing Anything:
- Breathe deeply
- Relax your body
- Stop resisting
- Move toward, not away

### The Mantra:
"Let go. Let go. Let go."

### Why This Works:
Resistance creates suffering. What you resist persists. Surrender allows material to move through.

---

## The TIP Technique

A simple framework for navigation:

### T - Trust
- Trust the process
- Trust the medicine
- Trust yourself
- Trust that this is happening for a reason

### I - In
- Go IN, not away
- Move toward difficulty, not against it
- Dive deeper into sensations
- Follow the thread wherever it leads

### P - Patience
- Don't rush through anything
- Let experiences complete themselves
- Stay with what's arising
- The process has its own timing

---

## Working with Breath

Breath is your most important tool:

### When Intensity Rises:
- Deepen your breath
- Slow it down
- Breathe into the body
- Let breath carry you

### When Fear Arises:
- Full, slow exhales
- Ground in breath
- Use breath as anchor
- Remember: if you're breathing, you're okay

### Types of Breathing:
- Deep belly breaths for grounding
- Connected breathing for moving energy
- Slow breathing for calming
- Natural breathing for surrender

---

## Body Awareness

### Stay in the Body:
- Sensations are your guide
- The body shows what's happening
- Follow physical feelings
- Let them intensify and release

### When Something Arises:
- Where do you feel it in your body?
- Can you breathe into that area?
- Can you relax around it?
- Can you let it be fully felt?

### Physical Movement:
- Movement may want to happen
- Let the body move if it wants to
- Shake, stretch, rock if needed
- Don't suppress physical impulses

## Working with Content

### Whatever Appears:
- Visions, memories, emotions, sensations
- All are worthy of attention
- None need to be rejected
- Curiosity, not judgment

### Questions to Hold:
- "What is this showing me?"
- "What wants to be felt?"
- "What am I learning?"
- (Hold these lightly, don't analyze constantly)

### Don't Try to:
- Make sense of everything in real-time
- Remember everything for later
- Control what appears
- Have a specific type of experience

---

## The Witness

### Cultivate the Observer:
- Part of you watching the experience
- Aware of what's happening
- Not caught in it completely
- Calm center amid intensity

### Phrases That Help:
- "I'm having this experience"
- "This is arising"
- "I notice..."
- "Something in me feels..."

### The Balance:
Enough witness to stay oriented. Not so much witness that you're detached and unable to fully experience.

---

## Physical Environment

### Darkness vs. Light:
- Eyes closed / eye mask often helps go inward
- Opening eyes can help if overwhelmed
- Natural light or soft lighting
- Adjust as needed

### Sound:
- Music can guide or support
- Silence has its place too
- Adjust based on what's happening
- Let sound wash through you

### Position:
- Lying down for going deep
- Sitting up for groundedness
- Moving if the body wants to
- Change as needed

---

## Relating to the Medicine

### Some Traditions Recommend:
- Thanking the medicine
- Asking for guidance
- Dialoguing with the experience
- Requesting help with difficulty

### However It Fits for You:
- Respectful relationship
- Not demanding, not passive
- Collaborative
- Open to what it offers

---

## Time and Phases

### Experiences Have Phases:
- **Onset:** Coming up, transition
- **Peak:** Most intense period
- **Plateau:** Sustained but stable
- **Descent:** Coming down
- **Return:** Landing back

### Each Phase:
- Has its character
- Requires different approach
- Can bring different content
- Will pass

### Important:
During peak intensity, remember: this will change. No state lasts forever.

## Communicating Needs

### If You Have Support Present:
- You can communicate needs
- "I need a blanket"
- "Can you sit with me?"
- "I need space right now"

### What Support Can Do:
- Provide reassurance
- Physical comfort
- Grounding presence
- Hold space without interfering

### Generally:
- Less talking is often better
- Stay with the inner experience
- Communicate necessities only
- Trust your support to be there

---

## Orientation Anchors

### If You Get Very Lost:
- Feel your body
- Feel your breath
- Feel the ground beneath you
- Remember your name, where you are

### Grounding Phrases:
- "I am [name]"
- "I am having an experience"
- "This will pass"
- "I am safe"

### Physical Grounding:
- Feel your hands
- Touch something solid
- Drink water
- Open eyes, look around

---

## What Not to Do

### Avoid:
- Fighting the experience
- Trying to control everything
- Constant analysis
- Reaching for phone
- Excessive talking
- Refusing to feel things
- Demanding specific outcomes

### These Block the Process:
The more you grip, the less can happen. Surrender enables movement.

## What's Next

In Module 5, you'll learn how to work with difficulty specifically—what to do when the experience gets challenging.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice deep breathing
- Work on surrender in daily life
- Create your personal navigation framework

---

*The best navigation is simple: surrender, breathe, trust. When in doubt, let go more. When struggling, breathe deeper. When lost, trust more. The experience knows where it's going. Your job is to allow it.*
