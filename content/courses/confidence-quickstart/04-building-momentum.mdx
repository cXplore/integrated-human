## Beyond Quick Fixes

The techniques you've learned work—but lasting confidence requires more than techniques. It requires action, accumulated evidence, and ongoing practice. This module helps you build momentum that transforms momentary boosts into lasting confidence.

---

## Action Builds Confidence

### The Core Truth

One of the most important truths about confidence:
- Action creates confidence
- Not the other way around
- Waiting to feel confident keeps you stuck
- Taking action—despite fear—builds real confidence

### The Evidence Principle

Confidence grows from evidence:
- Each action creates evidence
- Evidence of what you can do
- Evidence you can handle outcomes
- Evidence accumulates into confidence

### Start Small

You don't need big actions:
- Small actions count
- Each one creates evidence
- Small successes build bigger ones
- Momentum compounds

## Collecting Evidence

### The Evidence File

Keep track of:
- Things you've accomplished
- Challenges you've handled
- Positive feedback received
- Times you showed capability

### Why This Matters

An evidence file:
- Counters the inner critic
- Reminds you of your capability
- Builds over time
- Provides ammunition when confidence wavers

### Regular Review

Review your evidence:
- When confidence is low
- Before challenges
- As a regular practice
- To reinforce what you know

---

<Journal
  id="bm-evidence"
