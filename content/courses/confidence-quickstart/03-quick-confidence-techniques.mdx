### Visualization

- Picture yourself confident
- Visualize handling the situation well
- See the positive outcome
- Feel it as if it's happening

### Evidence Review

Remind yourself:
- Past successes
- Challenges you've handled
- Skills you have
- What others have valued

## Preparation Techniques

### Get Ready

Preparation builds confidence:
- Know your material
- Practice beforehand
- Anticipate challenges
- Have backup plans

### Over-Prepare, Then Let Go

The paradox:
- Prepare more than you think you need
- Then release attachment to outcome
- Preparation gives you a base
- Letting go frees you to perform

### Small Wins First

Build momentum:
- Start with smaller challenges
- Get some wins under your belt
- Build confidence through evidence
- Then take on bigger things

---

## The Pre-Challenge Routine

### Create Your Ritual

Before confidence-requiring situations:
1. **Physical:** Power pose, breathe, move
2. **Mental:** Review evidence, positive self-talk
3. **Focus:** Visualize success
4. **Release:** Let go of outcome attachment

### Practice Makes Automatic

The more you use this:
- The more natural it becomes
- The faster it works
- The more accessible confidence is
- It becomes habit

<Callout type="important">
These techniques work—but only if you use them. Practice them when you don't need them so they're available when you do. Before any confidence-requiring situation, run through your routine. Over time, confidence becomes more accessible and you'll need the techniques less. But they'll always be there when you need a boost.
