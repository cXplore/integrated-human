## What's Blocking You?

Before you can build confidence, you need to understand what's undermining it. Self-doubt doesn't come from nowhere—it has sources. This module helps you identify what's blocking your confidence so you can address it directly.

## Common Confidence Blockers

### The Inner Critic

That voice in your head:
- "You're not good enough"
- "Who do you think you are?"
- "You'll fail"
- "Others are better"

The inner critic attacks your confidence constantly.

### Fear of Failure

Worrying that:
- You'll mess up
- You'll be embarrassed
- You can't handle the outcome
- Failure means you're not worthy

### Fear of Judgment

Worrying that:
- Others will think poorly of you
- You'll look stupid
- People are watching and evaluating
- You won't measure up

### Comparison

Constantly measuring against others:
- They're more successful
- They're more confident
- You don't stack up
- You're behind

## Where Did This Come From?

### Early Messages

Often from childhood:
- Critical parents or teachers
- Comparisons to siblings
- Not being good enough
- Conditional love

### Formative Experiences

Events that shaped you:
- Public failures
- Rejection or ridicule
- Not being picked
- Being told you couldn't

### These Aren't Facts

Important to remember:
- These are learned patterns
- They felt true but weren't necessarily
- What you were told isn't who you are
- Patterns can be changed

## The Confidence Cycle

### The Negative Cycle

How blockers keep you stuck:
1. Believe you can't
2. Avoid or hesitate
3. Don't build evidence
4. Confidence stays low
5. More belief you can't

### Breaking the Cycle

The way out:
1. Recognize the pattern
2. Take action anyway
3. Build evidence
4. Confidence grows
5. Take more action

<Exercise title="Your Pattern">

Recognize your confidence pattern.

<Journal
  id="ycb-pattern"
  prompt="Map your pattern:

THE BELIEF:
What limiting belief about yourself operates?

THE AVOIDANCE:
What do you avoid because of it?

THE COST:
What is this pattern costing you?

THE TRUTH:
What's more accurate than the limiting belief?

BREAKING IT:
What action would break this pattern?"

## Quick Reframes

### For the Inner Critic

When it speaks:
- "That's just my inner critic, not truth"
- "Would I talk to a friend this way?"
- "What's the evidence against this?"
- "This voice isn't serving me"

### For Fear of Failure

Remember:
- Failure is information, not verdict
- Everyone who succeeds also fails
- You've handled failure before
- The cost of not trying is higher

### For Fear of Judgment

Remember:
- People think about you less than you imagine
- Those who judge harshly aren't your people
- You can't please everyone
- Self-assessment matters more

### For Comparison

Remember:
- You see their highlight reel
- You don't know their struggles
- Your path is unique
- Focus on your own growth

<Exercise title="Your Reframes">

Create reframes for your blockers.

For your biggest blocker, create counter-statements:

THE BLOCKER:
What's the blocking thought or fear?

REFRAME 1:
What's a more helpful way to think about this?

REFRAME 2:
Another way to see it?

REFRAME 3:
One more reframe?

## Key Concepts

- **Common blockers:** Inner critic, fear of failure, fear of judgment, comparison
- **Origins:** Often from early messages and formative experiences
- **Not facts:** These are learned patterns, not truths about you
- **The cycle:** Belief → avoidance → no evidence → low confidence
- **Breaking it:** Action creates evidence that builds confidence
- **Reframes:** Counter the blockers with more accurate perspectives

<Callout type="important">
Your confidence blockers feel true, but they're learned patterns—not facts about who you are. The inner critic, the fear of failure, the comparison trap—these developed from experiences, not from some inherent inadequacy. Understanding what blocks you is the first step to dismantling it.
</Callout>

*What's blocking you isn't truth about who you are—it's programming that can be changed.*
