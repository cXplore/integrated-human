## The Voices in Your Head

When you try to figure out what you want, whose voices do you hear?

- Your parents' hopes and fears
- Society's definitions of success
- Your partner's preferences
- Friends' opinions
- Cultural expectations
- The "responsible" voice
- The "practical" voice

**To find your path, you must first clear the noise of everyone else's paths.**

---

## External vs. Internal Guidance

### External Guidance:
- What others want for you
- What seems practical or safe
- What society values
- What you were raised to pursue
- What would make others proud

### Internal Guidance:
- What genuinely interests you
- What feels alive and true
- What you'd want if no one was watching
- What calls to you
- What your body says yes to

**Most of us have been trained to follow external guidance and ignore internal guidance.**

---

## Common Sources of Noise

### Parents
- Their hopes and fears projected onto you
- Their unlived dreams
- Their definition of success/safety
- "We just want you to be happy" (but only if...)

### Culture
- Success = money, status, achievement
- The "right" timeline (school, job, marriage, kids)
- What your gender/class/background "should" do
- What counts as a real job or valuable contribution

### Past Self
- What you used to want but no longer do
- Identity attached to old goals
- Sunk cost reasoning ("I've come this far")
- Who you thought you'd become

### Fear
- What seems safe
- Avoiding failure
- Avoiding judgment
- The familiar, even if wrong

  prompt="What do your parents (or caregivers) want for you? What would make them proud? What would disappoint them? How much does this voice influence you?"

## The "Should" Inventory

Much of what feels like personal direction is actually accumulated "shoulds."

### Examples:
- "I should have a stable career"
- "I should be further along by now"
- "I should want kids/marriage/success"
- "I should be more practical"
- "I should know what I want"

**Shoulds are external expectations internalized as personal desires.**

<Exercise title="Your Shoulds">

<Journal
  id="should-list"
  prompt="Make a list of your 'shoulds.' What do you feel you should want, be, do, or have? Write as many as you can."
  placeholder="I should...&#10;I should...&#10;I should...&#10;I should...&#10;I should..."
  rows={10}
/>

<Journal
  id="should-source"
  prompt="Pick 3-5 shoulds from your list. For each, ask: Where did this come from? Is this actually what I want?"
  placeholder="'I should...' came from... Is this what I want?&#10;&#10;'I should...' came from... Is this what I want?&#10;&#10;'I should...' came from... Is this what I want?"
  rows={10}
/>

## Finding Your Own Voice

Your voice is often quiet—because it was trained to be quiet.

### Signs of Your True Voice:
- Genuine curiosity or interest
- Energy and aliveness
- A pull toward something
- "I wonder what it would be like to..."
- The thing you do when no one's watching
- What you'd choose if you weren't afraid

### Signs of Noise:
- "I should"
- Heavy obligation
- What you're "supposed" to do
- Dread or deadness
- Doing it for others' approval
- Fear of what others would think

## The Fear of Disappointing Others

One of the biggest barriers to following your path is fear of disappointing people who matter to you.

### Common Fears:
- "My parents will be devastated"
- "My partner won't support this"
- "I'll look like a failure"
- "People will judge me"
- "I'll lose relationships"

### The Reality:
- Some people will be disappointed
- That's not your responsibility to manage
- The right people will adjust
- Living your life isn't selfish
- Their expectations are about them, not you

<Exercise title="Fear of Disappointment">

<Journal
  id="who-disappointed"
  prompt="Whose disappointment do you most fear? What do they want for you that might not be what you want?"
  placeholder="I most fear disappointing:&#10;&#10;They want me to:&#10;&#10;What I actually want might be different because:"
  rows={8}

  placeholder="Living for others has cost me...&#10;&#10;I've given up or not pursued..."

## Creating Space

To hear your own voice, you may need to create space:

### Reduce Input:
- Less advice-seeking
- Less comparison on social media
- Less news and noise
- Time alone

### Create Stillness:
- Meditation or quiet time
- Journaling without agenda
- Nature
- Boredom (let it be boring)

### Ask Different Questions:
- Not "What should I do?" but "What do I want?"
- Not "What's practical?" but "What's alive?"
- Not "What would they think?" but "What's true for me?"

<Exercise title="Creating Space">

<Journal
  id="space-creation"
  prompt="How could you create more space to hear your own voice? What noise could you reduce? What stillness could you create?"
  placeholder="I could create more space by:&#10;&#10;Noise I could reduce:&#10;&#10;Stillness I could create:"
  rows={6}
/>

<Journal
  id="commitment-space"
  prompt="What's one thing you'll do this week to create more space? Be specific."
  placeholder="This week I will..."
  rows={4}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Practice of Distinguishing

Getting clear isn't a one-time event. It's ongoing practice.

### Daily Practice:
When you notice a desire or direction, ask:
- Is this my voice or someone else's?
- Does this feel like obligation or genuine want?
- Would I want this if no one knew?
- Is this coming from fear or from desire?

Over time, you'll get better at recognizing the difference.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Noise:** The accumulated expectations, opinions, and shoulds from others that cloud your own knowing.

- **External vs. Internal Guidance:** The difference between what others want for you and what you actually want.

- **Shoulds:** External expectations that have been internalized as personal desires.

- **Your True Voice:** The quieter knowing that gets drowned out by noise—often marked by genuine curiosity and aliveness.

- **Creating Space:** Reducing input and creating stillness to hear your own voice.

---

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll learn to follow your energy—using aliveness and genuine interest as a compass when direction is unclear.

**Before moving on:**
- Notice how much noise affects your decisions
- Practice asking "Is this mine or someone else's?"
- Create some space this week to hear yourself

---

*Your path won't be found in someone else's expectations. It will be found in your own quiet knowing.*
