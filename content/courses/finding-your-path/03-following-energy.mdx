## The Energy Compass

When you don't know where to go, follow your energy.

Energy is your body's way of saying "yes" or "no" to life. What enlivens you, interests you, draws you—that's pointing toward your path.

**You don't need to figure out the whole path. You just need to follow what's alive.**

---

## What Is "Energy"?

In this context, energy means:

### Aliveness:
- Feeling more awake, present, engaged
- Interest and curiosity
- A sense of "yes"
- Wanting to know more, do more, explore more

### Deadness:
- Feeling drained, flat, heavy
- Going through the motions
- Resistance and avoidance
- A sense of "no" or "ugh"

**Your energy is giving you constant feedback about what's right for you.**

## Why Energy Works

### Energy Points to Fit
When something fits you—genuinely matches who you are—it gives you energy. When something doesn't fit, it drains you.

### Energy Bypasses the Mind
Your mind can rationalize anything. Your energy doesn't lie.

### Energy Is Immediate
You don't need to think about whether something gives you energy. You feel it.

### Energy Accumulates
Following energy leads to more energy. Ignoring energy leads to depletion.

  prompt="What gives you energy? What activities, topics, people, or experiences make you feel more alive? List as many as you can."
  placeholder="What gives me energy:&#10;&#10;Activities:&#10;&#10;Topics:&#10;&#10;People:&#10;&#10;Experiences:"

## Reading Your Energy

### Signs of High Energy:
- Time passes quickly (flow state)
- Curiosity and questions arise
- You want to know more
- Physical sensations of openness
- Eagerness to return to it
- Feeling more like yourself

### Signs of Low Energy:
- Time drags
- Resistance and avoidance
- Relief when it's over
- Physical heaviness or tension
- Dreading it
- Feeling disconnected from yourself

---

## The Curiosity Trail

One powerful version of following energy: follow your curiosity.

### How It Works:
1. Notice what you're genuinely curious about
2. Explore it (read, try, investigate)
3. See what leads to more curiosity
4. Follow that next thread
5. Repeat

### The Path Emerges:
You don't need to know where curiosity leads. You just need to follow it. The path reveals itself through the following.

<Exercise title="Curiosity Inventory">

<Journal
  id="current-curiosity"
  prompt="What are you genuinely curious about right now? What questions interest you? What would you explore if you had time?"
  placeholder="I'm curious about...&#10;&#10;Questions that interest me:&#10;&#10;What I'd explore if I had time:"
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="suppressed-curiosity"
  prompt="What curiosities have you suppressed or dismissed as impractical? What interests have you told yourself you shouldn't pursue?"
  placeholder="Curiosities I've suppressed:&#10;&#10;Why I suppressed them:&#10;&#10;What I told myself about them:"

## Energy vs. Comfort

Important distinction: energy is not the same as comfort.

### Comfortable but Dead:
- The safe job that bores you
- Relationships without growth
- Staying in the known
- Avoiding discomfort at the cost of aliveness

### Uncomfortable but Alive:
- Challenges that stretch you
- Scary but exciting
- Growth edges
- The thing you want but fear

**Follow energy, even when it leads to discomfort.**

## The "Hell Yes" Test

One heuristic: If it's not a "hell yes," it's a "no."

### How to Use:
When considering something, check your energy:
- Is there genuine enthusiasm? (Hell yes)
- Is it lukewarm obligation? (No)
- Are you trying to convince yourself? (No)
- Does it feel alive? (Hell yes)

### Limitation:
This works better for new opportunities than for ongoing commitments. Not everything you're committed to will feel like "hell yes" every day.

---

<Exercise title="Hell Yes Audit">

<Journal
  id="hell-yes-life"
  prompt="What in your current life is a 'hell yes'—genuinely alive and wanted? What's a lukewarm 'yes' you've been settling for?"
  placeholder="Hell yes in my life:&#10;&#10;Lukewarm yes I'm settling for:&#10;&#10;Things I'm doing out of obligation:"
  rows={8}
/>

## Small Steps of Energy

You don't need grand moves. Just follow energy in small ways:

### Examples:
- Read the book that interests you (not the one you "should" read)
- Have coffee with the person you're genuinely curious about
- Take the class that excites you (even if impractical)
- Spend an hour on what you love
- Say no to what drains you
- Say yes to what enlivens you

### The Path Is Built Step by Step:
Each step of energy leads to the next. You don't need the whole map.

## When Energy Is Blocked

Sometimes you can't feel your energy. Reasons:

### Numbness:
- You've ignored energy so long it's quiet
- Depression or burnout has flatlined everything
- You're disconnected from your body

### Solution:
- Slow down enough to feel
- Try many things to see what generates any response
- Work on depression/burnout as its own issue
- Reconnect with your body

### Fear:
- You feel energy but fear following it
- What you want seems impractical or risky
- Others wouldn't approve

### Solution:
- Acknowledge the fear (Module 5)
- Follow energy in small, safe ways first
- Separate feeling from acting

## Daily Practice

### Energy Tracking:
Throughout the day, notice:
- What gave you energy?
- What drained energy?
- When did you feel most alive?
- When did you feel most dead?

### Weekly Reflection:
- Where did I follow energy this week?
- Where did I ignore it?
- What pattern do I notice?

### Monthly Direction:
- What's consistently giving energy?
- What should I do less of?
- What should I explore more?

## Key Concepts

- **Energy as Compass:** What enlivens you points toward your path; what drains you points away.

- **Aliveness vs. Deadness:** The felt sense of "yes" versus "no" in your body.

- **Following Curiosity:** Letting genuine interest lead you, one thread at a time.

- **Energy vs. Comfort:** Energy can lead to discomfort; comfort can be dead.

- **Small Steps:** Following energy in small ways builds the path incrementally.

---

## What's Next

In Module 4, you'll learn to take action through experiments—moving forward without requiring certainty about the whole path.

**Before moving on:**
- Track your energy for a few days
- Notice what enlivens vs. drains you
- Take one small step toward what interests you

---

*You don't need a plan. You need to feel what's alive. The path is built by following that aliveness, one step at a time.*
