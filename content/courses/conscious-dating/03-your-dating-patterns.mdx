## Patterns Repeat Until Understood

Do you keep attracting the same type of person? Keep having the same relationship problems? Keep making the same mistakes?

You're not unlucky. You're caught in patterns. Understanding these patterns—where they come from and how they operate—is essential for breaking them.

## Common Dating Patterns

### Attraction Patterns

Who you're drawn to:
- Unavailable people (emotionally, logistically, or otherwise)
- "Projects" who need fixing
- People who reflect your wounds
- Intensity mistaken for connection
- Familiar family dynamics

### Behavior Patterns

How you act in dating:
- Pursuing too hard or withdrawing
- Ignoring red flags
- Moving too fast or too slow
- People-pleasing and losing yourself
- Avoiding vulnerability or oversharing
- Self-sabotage when things go well

### Relationship Patterns

How relationships unfold:
- Same problems, different person
- Same ending each time
- Same point where things fall apart
- Repeating family relationship dynamics
- Choosing partners who confirm negative beliefs

## Attachment Style

### Understanding Attachment

Your early relationships created templates:
- How safe is closeness?
- What do you expect from partners?
- How do you behave when threatened?
- What triggers your defenses?

Attachment styles aren't destiny, but they affect dating profoundly.

### The Four Styles

**Secure:**
- Comfortable with intimacy
- Can handle conflict
- Doesn't get too anxious or avoidant
- Regulates emotions well
- About 50-60% of population

**Anxious:**
- Fears abandonment
- Needs reassurance
- Can become clingy or demanding
- Hypervigilant to partner's state
- Often attracted to avoidants

**Avoidant:**
- Fears engulfment
- Values independence highly
- Pulls away when things get close
- Suppresses emotions
- Often attracted to anxious

**Disorganized (Fearful-Avoidant):**
- Wants closeness but fears it
- Push-pull behavior
- Often related to trauma
- Chaotic relationship patterns

### How Attachment Plays Out

In dating:
- Anxious folks may pursue, seek reassurance, fear rejection
- Avoidant folks may pull back, keep distance, feel smothered
- Secure folks can handle closeness and space
- Disorganized folks may oscillate unpredictably

Understanding your style helps you catch yourself.

<Exercise title="Identifying Your Patterns">

Examine your dating patterns.

### Part 1: Attraction Patterns

<Journal
  id="dp-attraction"
  prompt="Look at who you're attracted to:

• What 'type' do you typically go for?
• What qualities draw you to someone initially?
• In hindsight, are these healthy qualities or warning signs?
• Do you notice attraction to unavailable people?
• Is there a pattern in who you choose?"

### Part 2: Behavior Patterns

<Journal
  id="dp-behavior"
  prompt="Examine how you behave in dating:

• Do you pursue or wait to be pursued?
• How quickly do you get attached?
• How do you handle uncertainty in early dating?
• Do you tend to lose yourself or keep too much distance?
• What do you do when things feel threatening?"

### Part 3: Relationship Patterns

<Journal
  id="dp-relationship"
  prompt="Consider how your relationships have unfolded:

• What problems tend to repeat?
• At what point do things typically fall apart?
• What role do you play in difficulties?
• What feedback have you gotten from partners?
• What patterns might you share with your parents' relationship?"

  prompt="Assess your attachment tendencies:

• Do you tend toward anxiety (fear of abandonment, need reassurance)?
• Do you tend toward avoidance (fear of too much closeness, pull back)?
• Both at different times?
• How does this show up in dating?
• Where might this come from?"

## Where Patterns Come From

### Family of Origin

Your first relationships were templates:
- How your parents related (to each other and to you)
- What love looked like in your home
- How conflict was handled
- What you learned about your worth
- Emotional availability of caregivers

We often recreate or react against family patterns.

### Past Relationships

Previous experiences shape expectations:
- What worked and didn't
- How you were treated
- Wounds that still affect you
- Conclusions you drew about relationships

Past doesn't have to be prologue—but often is without awareness.

### Core Beliefs

Beliefs about yourself and relationships:
- "I'm not good enough"
- "Love is dangerous"
- "I always get hurt"
- "I don't deserve love"
- "People always leave"

These beliefs filter experience and become self-fulfilling.

### Wounds and Defenses

Emotional wounds create defenses:
- Hurt → Wall
- Betrayal → Hypervigilance
- Abandonment → Clinginess
- Engulfment → Distance
- Criticism → Perfecting or hiding

Defenses protected you once. They may not serve you now.

## The Anxious-Avoidant Trap

### The Dance

A common pattern:
1. Anxious person pursues
2. Avoidant person withdraws
3. Anxious pursues harder
4. Avoidant withdraws more
5. Both feel confirmed in fears

This dance can feel intense and "chemistry-laden" but is often just pattern matching.

### Why It Feels Like Chemistry

This pairing feels familiar:
- Intensity feels like passion
- Drama feels like love
- Push-pull feels exciting
- Familiar patterns feel right

But intensity isn't intimacy. Drama isn't depth.

### Breaking the Dance

Awareness helps:
- Anxious folks: learn to self-soothe, not pursue
- Avoidant folks: learn to stay present, communicate
- Both: date securely attached people
- Both: work on your own attachment wounds

## Red Flags and Your Filters

### Why We Miss Red Flags

Patterns make us blind:
- Chemistry overrides discernment
- Familiarity feels like connection
- Hope overrides evidence
- We see what we want to see
- We explain away what doesn't fit

### Common Red Flags

Warning signs to notice:
- Inconsistent behavior (words don't match actions)
- Disrespect toward you or others
- Unwillingness to talk about difficult things
- Excessive intensity too soon
- Blame-shifting and lack of accountability
- Controlling behavior
- Dishonesty
- Unavailability (emotional or practical)

### Building Better Filters

Pay attention to:
- How they treat service workers
- How they talk about exes
- Whether they take responsibility
- Consistency over time
- Actions, not just words
- Your body's signals

Red flags are red for everyone. Your pattern may make you colorblind.

---

## Changing Patterns

### Awareness First

You can't change what you don't see:
- Notice the pattern
- Understand where it comes from
- See how it operates
- Catch yourself in the moment

### Pause Before Reacting

When triggered:
- Notice the urge (to pursue, withdraw, etc.)
- Pause before acting
- Ask: Is this my pattern or a genuine response?
- Choose intentionally

### Different Choices

Pattern change requires different behavior:
- If you always pursue, practice waiting
- If you always withdraw, practice staying
- If you ignore red flags, slow down
- If you move fast, move slow

This will feel uncomfortable. Discomfort is part of change.

### Support

This work is hard:
- Therapy can help
- Friends who see your patterns
- Journaling and self-reflection
- Patience with yourself

Patterns took years to develop. They take time to change.

<Exercise title="Pattern Interruption Plan">

Create a plan for changing your patterns.

### Part 1: Your Core Pattern

<Journal
  id="dp-core"
  prompt="Identify your most problematic dating pattern:

• What's the pattern? (Describe it specifically)
• Where does it come from?
• How has it hurt you?
• What would be different without it?"
  placeholder="The pattern:

Origin:

How it's hurt me:

What would be different:..."
  rows={12}
/>

### Part 2: Interruption Points

<Journal
  id="dp-interrupt"
  prompt="Identify where you can interrupt the pattern:

• At what point do you typically get caught in the pattern?
• What are the warning signs you're about to repeat it?
• What could you do differently at that point?
• What might make it easier to choose differently?"
  placeholder="Where I get caught:

Warning signs:

What I could do differently:

What would help:..."
  rows={12}

### Part 3: Support System

<Journal
  id="dp-support"
  prompt="Build support for pattern change:

• Who can you talk to about this?
• What might therapy offer?
• How will you be compassionate with yourself when you slip?
• What will you do when changing feels too hard?"
  placeholder="Who I can talk to:

What therapy might offer:

## Key Concepts

- **Patterns repeat:** Same attractions, behaviors, problems repeat until understood
- **Attachment styles:** Anxious, avoidant, secure, disorganized—all affect dating
- **Origins:** Family, past relationships, core beliefs, wounds
- **Anxious-avoidant trap:** Intensity feels like chemistry but is often just patterns
- **Red flags:** Patterns make us blind to warning signs
- **Change:** Awareness, pause, different choices, support

<Callout type="important">
Your patterns aren't character flaws. They're adaptations that made sense once. Understanding them with compassion—not shame—makes change possible. You're not broken. You're patterned. And patterns can change.
