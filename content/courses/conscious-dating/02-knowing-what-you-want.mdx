## Clarity Before Swiping

Most people start dating without knowing what they're looking for. They know they want "someone great" or "a connection," but that's too vague to be useful.

Getting clear on what you actually need—your values, your non-negotiables, your relationship vision—transforms dating from aimless swiping to purposeful searching.

## Why Clarity Matters

### Without Clarity

When you don't know what you want:
- You evaluate people on vibes and chemistry only
- You accept whatever shows up
- You discover incompatibilities after investing
- You stay too long in wrong relationships
- You don't know if someone is a good match

### With Clarity

When you know what you want:
- You have criteria for evaluation
- You can screen effectively
- You recognize good matches faster
- You know what to ask about
- You have grounds for decisions

Clarity isn't about being rigid. It's about knowing what matters.

## Values: The Foundation

### What Are Values?

Values are what matters most to you:
- How you want to live
- What you prioritize
- What you stand for
- What makes life meaningful

Values guide everything. Partners with misaligned values struggle constantly.

### Common Relationship Values

Consider which matter to you:
- Family orientation
- Career and ambition
- Financial priorities
- Adventure vs. stability
- Independence vs. togetherness
- Growth and learning
- Spirituality or faith
- Health and fitness
- Social life and community
- Creativity and expression

### Shared vs. Compatible Values

You don't need identical values:
- Some values need to match (kids, location, major lifestyle)
- Some just need to be compatible (how much social time, adventure level)
- Some differences can enrich (one's strength complements other's weakness)

The key is: core values should align.

## Needs: What You Require

### Needs vs. Wants

**Needs:** Essential for relationship to work
- Without them, you'll be chronically unhappy
- Non-negotiable requirements
- Core to who you are

**Wants:** Preferred but flexible
- Nice to have
- Can be compromised on
- Not essential for happiness

### Common Relationship Needs

Consider what you need:
- Emotional availability and responsiveness
- Physical affection level
- Quality time amount
- Communication style
- Sexual compatibility
- Trust and reliability
- Respect and appreciation
- Support for your goals
- Compatible lifestyle
- Aligned life direction

### Knowing Your Needs

How to identify what you actually need:
- What was missing in past relationships that was painful?
- What do you absolutely need to feel loved?
- What would you eventually resent not having?
- What can you truly not be happy without?

Be honest. Pretending you don't need something won't make the need go away.

## Non-Negotiables: Hard Lines

### What Are Non-Negotiables?

Non-negotiables are absolute deal-breakers:
- No amount of chemistry overrides them
- They're not flexible or negotiable
- If present (or absent), you walk away
- No second chances on these

### Types of Non-Negotiables

**Character traits:**
- Honesty and integrity
- Kindness and respect
- Emotional maturity

**Life direction:**
- Wants/doesn't want children
- Location and willingness to move
- Career and ambition alignment

**Lifestyle:**
- Substance use
- Health and fitness priorities
- Financial responsibility

**Deal-breakers:**
- Active addiction
- Abuse or violence
- Fundamental dishonesty
- Already in a relationship

### Setting Non-Negotiables

Be ruthless about essentials, flexible about preferences:
- Keep the list short (5-10 items max)
- Only include what truly matters
- Don't mistake preferences for non-negotiables
- Be willing to enforce them

If your list is 50 items long, you're filtering for perfection, not compatibility.

## The Trap of "Type"

### What's Your Type?

Many people have a "type":
- Physical preferences
- Personality patterns
- Profession or status
- Age, height, appearance criteria

### The Problem with Types

Your type may not be serving you:
- Types are often based on attraction, not compatibility
- You may be attracted to what doesn't work for you
- Types exclude people who might be great matches
- Types often reflect unconscious patterns

### Expanding Your Range

Consider:
- What's behind your type preferences? (Attraction, security, status?)
- Has your type worked out in the past?
- Who might you be filtering out?
- What's the difference between physical attraction and "type"?

You need attraction. You don't need a rigid type.

## Relationship Vision

### What Kind of Relationship Do You Want?

Beyond who—what kind of partnership?
- How much time together vs. apart?
- How do you want to handle conflict?
- What roles and responsibilities?
- How do you want to grow together?
- What's the vibe? (Playful, calm, adventurous, domestic?)

### Life Vision Alignment

Where is your life heading?
- Career trajectory
- Geographic preferences
- Family plans
- Lifestyle choices
- Long-term goals

A partner should enhance your path, not derail it.

### Creating Together

What do you want to create?
- A home?
- A family?
- A shared mission?
- Adventures?
- A business?
- A community?

Shared vision creates shared direction.

---

## Being Realistic

### Perfection Doesn't Exist

No one will meet every criterion:
- Everyone has flaws
- Trade-offs are inevitable
- Perfect on paper doesn't mean perfect for you
- Connection matters beyond checklists

### The Enough Question

Ask: Is this person enough?
- Enough emotional availability?
- Enough shared values?
- Enough attraction?
- Enough respect?
- Enough compatibility?

You're not looking for maximum everything. You're looking for enough of what matters.

### Growth and Change

People (including you) change:
- Some things improve
- Some things don't
- Potential isn't the same as reality
- Character tends to stay stable
- Specific behaviors can change

Don't date potential. Date who they are now.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Values:** What matters most—partners need aligned core values
- **Needs:** What you require to be happy in relationship
- **Non-negotiables:** Hard lines that aren't flexible
- **Type traps:** Your type may not be serving you
- **Relationship vision:** The kind of partnership you want
- **Realistic expectations:** Perfection doesn't exist; look for "enough"

---

<Callout type="important">
Clarity isn't about creating impossible standards. It's about knowing what actually matters so you can focus on compatibility rather than chemistry alone. Keep your non-negotiables short and essential. Be flexible on preferences. Stay open to surprise.
</Callout>

*You can't find what you're looking for if you don't know what it is.*
