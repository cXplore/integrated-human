## The Beginning Is Everything

Early dating sets the foundation. How you navigate these first weeks and months shapes the trajectory of what follows.

This stage requires balance: staying open while staying discerning, moving forward while not rushing, enjoying connection while gathering information.

---

## The Purpose of Early Dating

### What You're Doing

Early dating is primarily about:
- Learning who this person is
- Assessing compatibility
- Noticing red and green flags
- Understanding their values and character
- Seeing how they treat you over time

It's information gathering, not relationship building. The relationship comes later, if the information warrants it.

### What You're Not Doing

Early dating is not:
- Committing prematurely
- Planning the wedding
- Ignoring concerning signs
- Forcing connection
- Deciding they're "the one" on date two

Slow down. You're evaluating, not executing.

---

## Pacing and Patience

### The Rush Problem

When things feel good, people rush:
- Constant texting immediately
- Seeing each other every day
- Exclusivity conversations on week one
- Moving in after a month
- "I love you" before you know them

Rushing feels exciting. It also bypasses discernment.

### Why Slower Is Better

Taking time allows:
- Patterns to emerge
- True character to show
- Rose-colored glasses to clear
- Compatibility to be assessed realistically
- Foundation to be solid

Fast relationships often crash fast.

### Healthy Pacing

What reasonable pacing looks like:
- 1-2 dates per week initially
- Gradual increase in communication
- Letting milestones happen naturally
- Not forcing "where is this going" too early
- Allowing things to unfold

There's no strict timeline. But faster isn't better.

## Gathering Information

### What to Pay Attention To

Observe:
- How they treat you when they're stressed
- How they talk about other people
- Whether words match actions
- How they handle conflict or disagreement
- Whether they're consistent over time
- How they respond to your boundaries
- What their life actually looks like

### What to Ask About

Questions that reveal character and compatibility:
- Past relationships (how they speak about exes)
- Goals and vision (where they're headed)
- Values (what matters to them)
- Family (relationship with family of origin)
- Lifestyle (how they actually live day to day)
- Conflict (how they handle disagreement)

Listen carefully to answers.

### Actions Over Words

Pay attention to what they do:
- Do they follow through on plans?
- Do they treat you well consistently?
- Are they reliable?
- Do their actions match their words?
- How do they behave when it's inconvenient?

Words are easy. Actions tell the truth.

## Red Flags and Green Flags

### Red Flags to Watch For

Warning signs in early dating:
- Inconsistency (hot and cold behavior)
- Love bombing (excessive intensity too soon)
- Blame shifting (nothing is ever their fault)
- Disrespect (toward you or others)
- Boundary violations
- Excessive jealousy or possessiveness
- Dishonesty (even "small" lies)
- Poor treatment of service workers
- All exes are "crazy"
- Pressure for commitment or intimacy

One red flag: notice. Multiple red flags: reconsider.

### Green Flags to Notice

Positive signs:
- Consistency between words and actions
- Respect for your boundaries
- Accountability when wrong
- Genuine interest in you (not just pursuing)
- Kindness to others
- Emotional availability
- Honesty even when hard
- Healthy relationships with others
- Self-awareness
- Following through

Green flags accumulate into trust.

### Trusting Your Gut

Your intuition picks up information:
- If something feels off, it probably is
- If you feel anxious constantly, pay attention
- If you feel at ease, that's data too
- Your body knows before your mind

Don't override your gut for chemistry.

---

## Staying Grounded

### Maintaining Your Life

Don't disappear into dating:
- Keep seeing friends
- Maintain your hobbies
- Stay focused on work/goals
- Continue self-care practices
- Remember who you are outside of this

A full life makes you a better partner and prevents over-investment in someone you barely know.

### Avoiding Over-Investment

Signs of over-investing too early:
- Constant thinking about them
- Neglecting other areas of life
- Emotional highs and lows based on their behavior
- Planning the future before you know them
- Losing yourself in the possibility

Stay present. This is early stages.

### Self-Soothing

When anxiety arises:
- Remind yourself: it's early, you don't know yet
- Avoid seeking constant reassurance
- Manage your own emotions
- Don't interpret their every action
- Stay busy with your own life

You can tolerate the uncertainty of early dating without spiraling.

## Communication and Texting

### Healthy Communication

Texting norms to consider:
- Match their energy (don't over-pursue)
- Keep some mystery (don't be available 24/7)
- Use texting for logistics, save depth for in-person
- Don't over-analyze message timing or content
- Be direct about what you want

### Setting the Tone

Early communication sets expectations:
- Respond at a reasonable pace (not instantly always)
- Be warm but don't overwhelm
- Express interest without chasing
- Maintain your own life between messages

### When Communication Feels Off

If communication is inconsistent:
- Notice the pattern
- Don't chase
- See if it continues
- Consider whether this meets your needs
- Address it calmly if needed

Poor communication early often means poor communication later.

## Physical Intimacy

### Pacing Intimacy

Physical intimacy timing varies:
- There's no right timeline
- It should feel right for you
- Pressure is a red flag
- You can say no at any point
- Waiting doesn't make you uptight; rushing doesn't make you easy

What matters is: it's your genuine choice.

### Emotional and Physical Together

Consider:
- Physical intimacy increases emotional attachment
- Chemistry can cloud judgment
- Intimacy before knowing someone can complicate assessment
- There's wisdom in waiting until you know more

### Communication About Intimacy

Be clear about:
- Your comfort level
- Your pace
- Your boundaries
- What you need to feel safe

A worthy partner will respect your communication.

## Key Concepts

- **Purpose:** Early dating is information gathering, not relationship building
- **Pacing:** Slower is usually better; rushing bypasses discernment
- **Information:** Actions over words; observe patterns over time
- **Red flags:** Notice warning signs; don't explain them away
- **Green flags:** Consistency, respect, honesty, reliability
- **Staying grounded:** Maintain your life; avoid over-investment
- **Gut feelings:** Trust your intuition; it picks up information you may not consciously see

---

<Callout type="important">
Early dating is when you have the most power to choose well. You're not yet attached. You can walk away cleanly. Use this window to gather information and make good decisions. The relationship you're building should earn your commitment—you shouldn't give it away prematurely.
</Callout>

*The beginning is everything. Pay attention, stay grounded, and trust what you see.*
