## The Foundation

Before you can use body awareness, you need to develop it. Many people have limited ability to feel their internal states—the sensation pathways have been neglected.

**This module teaches you to feel what's there.**

---

## Starting Simple

Body awareness develops through practice. Start with what's obvious, then develop sensitivity to subtler sensations.

### What You Might Feel:
- Tension/relaxation
- Temperature (warm/cool)
- Pressure/weight
- Movement (pulsing, vibrating, flowing)
- Hollowness/fullness
- Expansion/contraction
- Tingling/aliveness

### Start With:
- Big, obvious sensations
- External (skin, temperature)
- Familiar areas (often hands, face)

### Build Toward:
- Subtle, internal sensations
- Deep body awareness
- Emotional body states

---

## The Body Scan

The body scan is the foundational practice for developing body awareness.

### How to Do It:
1. Lie down or sit comfortably
2. Close your eyes
3. Bring attention to top of head
4. Slowly move attention through each body part
5. Notice what you notice—no judgment
6. If you feel nothing, that's information too
7. Continue through entire body
8. Rest in whole-body awareness at end

### Key Points:
- Not trying to change anything
- Just noticing what's there
- No right or wrong experience
- Stay curious, not critical
- "Numb" or "nothing" is data

<Exercise title="Body Scan Practice">

Take 10 minutes for a body scan. Then journal what you noticed.

<Journal
  id="scan-head"
  prompt="HEAD and FACE: What did you notice? Scalp, forehead, eyes, jaw, throat?"
  placeholder="I noticed..."
  rows={4}
/>

<Journal
  id="scan-torso"
  prompt="TORSO: What did you notice? Shoulders, chest, upper back, belly, lower back, pelvis?"
  placeholder="I noticed..."
  rows={4}
/>

<Journal
  id="scan-limbs"
  prompt="LIMBS: What did you notice? Arms, hands, legs, feet?"
  placeholder="I noticed..."
  rows={4}
/>

<Journal
  id="scan-overall"
  prompt="OVERALL: What was the experience like? Any areas of particular aliveness? Any areas of numbness?"
  placeholder="Overall, the experience was...&#10;&#10;Alive areas:&#10;&#10;Numb areas:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Working with Numbness

Many people discover areas that feel numb or blank. This is normal.

### What Numbness Means:
- Disconnection from that area
- Possible held tension (so held you can't feel it)
- Possible trauma storage
- Habitually ignored area
- Needs time and attention to come back online

### What to Do:
- Don't force sensation
- Be patient
- Keep returning attention gently
- Movement can help
- Breath can help
- Trust the process

**Numbness transforms into sensation with consistent, gentle attention.**

---

## Working with Pain

Sometimes body awareness brings attention to pain or discomfort.

### Approach:
- Notice it without fighting it
- Describe it (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.)
- Notice its exact location and size
- Notice if it changes with attention
- Don't force yourself to stay with overwhelming pain

### Distinction:
- **Pain as information:** This area needs attention
- **Pain as danger:** Get medical care
- **Chronic pain:** May benefit from somatic work, not just medical

## Feeling Emotions in the Body

Emotions are physical experiences. Each emotion has a signature in the body.

### Common Patterns:
- **Anger:** Chest, jaw, hands, heat
- **Fear:** Belly, chest, throat, cold
- **Sadness:** Chest, throat, heaviness
- **Joy:** Chest, face, lightness
- **Anxiety:** Chest, belly, scattered energy

### The Practice:
When you feel an emotion, ask: "Where do I feel this in my body? What does it feel like physically?"

This bridges emotion and body awareness.

<Exercise title="Emotion Mapping">

<Journal
  id="emotion-recent"
  prompt="Think of a recent emotional experience. What was the emotion? Where did you feel it in your body? What was the physical sensation?"
  placeholder="The emotion was:&#10;&#10;I felt it in:&#10;&#10;The physical sensation was:"
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="emotion-map"
  prompt="For these emotions, describe where you typically feel them and what they feel like physically:
• Anger
• Fear
• Sadness
• Joy"
  placeholder="Anger:&#10;&#10;Fear:&#10;&#10;Sadness:&#10;&#10;Joy:"
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## Breath Awareness

Breath is one of the easiest body sensations to feel.

### What to Notice:
- Where breath moves in body
- Depth (shallow/deep)
- Pace (fast/slow)
- Quality (smooth/ragged)
- Where it pauses or catches

### Breath and State:
Your breath reflects your state:
- Stressed: shallow, fast, upper chest
- Calm: slow, deep, belly
- Anxious: irregular, held
- Present: smooth, full

**Noticing breath is a gateway to body awareness.**

---

## Building the Practice

Body awareness develops through:

### Frequency
- Daily practice, even brief
- Multiple check-ins throughout day
- Regular formal practice (body scan)

### Variety
- Different areas of focus
- Different times of day
- Different states (stressed, calm, active, rest)

### Patience
- This takes time
- Sensitivity develops gradually
- Some areas take longer than others

---

<Exercise title="Daily Awareness Check-In">

Create a simple check-in you can do multiple times per day:

<Checklist
  id="checkin-elements"
  title="What will you include in your check-in? (Select 3-5)"
  items={[
    "Three deep breaths",
    "Notice feet on ground",
    "Scan for tension",
    "Feel heart area",
    "Notice belly sensations",
    "Check jaw and shoulders",
    "Feel hands",
    "Notice overall energy level",
    "Identify emotional state via body"
  ]}
/>

<Journal
  id="checkin-design"
  prompt="Write out your personal check-in practice. What will you do? When will you do it?"
  placeholder="My check-in practice:&#10;&#10;I'll do it:&#10;- Morning:&#10;- Midday:&#10;- Evening:"
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Common Challenges

### "I don't feel anything"
- Normal starting point
- Keep practicing
- Start with hands, feet, face (often more accessible)
- Movement before stillness can help

### "I feel too much"
- Titration: go slowly
- Ground yourself
- Take breaks
- Build capacity gradually

### "My mind wanders"
- Normal
- Gently return attention
- Body sensations are anchor points
- Wandering is part of practice

### "I fall asleep"
- Try sitting instead of lying
- Practice when more alert
- Shorter practices
- Some falling asleep is okay (body needed rest)

---

## Body Awareness and Daily Life

The goal isn't just feeling the body during practice—it's maintaining awareness throughout life.

### As You Build This:
- Notice body while working
- Feel body while in conversation
- Sense body while eating
- Maintain awareness during transitions
- Let body inform decisions

**Practice time builds capacity. Then you apply it to life.**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Body Scan:** Moving attention systematically through body to develop awareness.

- **Numbness:** Areas with reduced sensation—need patient attention to come online.

- **Emotion in Body:** All emotions have physical signatures—feeling the body helps identify and process emotions.

- **Breath Awareness:** Noticing breath as a gateway to broader body awareness.

- **Check-In:** Brief body awareness practice done multiple times daily.

---

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll learn grounding practices—specific techniques for coming down from the head into the body, especially useful when anxious, overthinking, or dissociated.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice body scan daily
- Create and use your check-in practice
- Notice emotions in your body

*Feeling your body is like learning a language. At first, it's all noise. With practice, you begin to understand what it's saying.*
