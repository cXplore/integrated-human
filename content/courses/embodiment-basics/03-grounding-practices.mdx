## What Is Grounding?

Grounding is the practice of bringing your attention from the head down into the body and into connection with the physical present moment.

### When You're Grounded:
- Present in your body
- Connected to physical sensations
- Aware of your environment
- Stable and centered
- Here, now

### When You're Ungrounded:
- Living in your head
- Lost in thoughts, worries, plans
- Disconnected from body
- Spacey or anxious
- Not really HERE

## When Grounding Helps

### Anxiety and Overwhelm
When the mind is racing, grounding brings you out of mental loops into body presence.

### Dissociation
When you feel floaty, unreal, or "not quite here," grounding reconnects you.

### After Triggers
When something has activated you, grounding helps you come back to baseline.

### Overthinking
When stuck in mental analysis, grounding provides an exit.

### Before Important Moments
Before meetings, conversations, or decisions—grounding creates presence.

## Grounding Through the Feet

The simplest grounding practice: feel your feet.

### The Practice:
1. Bring attention to your feet
2. Feel them on the floor
3. Notice weight, pressure, temperature
4. Feel connection to ground
5. Sense stability coming up through legs

### Why Feet:
- Farthest from head
- Direct contact with ground
- Draws energy downward
- Simple, available anytime

## Grounding Through the Senses

The 5-4-3-2-1 technique uses senses to ground in present reality.

### The Practice:
1. **5 things you see** - Look around, name them
2. **4 things you feel** - Physical sensations (clothes, temperature, seat)
3. **3 things you hear** - Sounds in environment
4. **2 things you smell** - Odors in the air
5. **1 thing you taste** - Taste in your mouth

### Why It Works:
- Engages multiple senses
- Brings attention to present reality
- Interrupts mental loops
- Creates concrete focus

## Grounding Through Breath

Using breath to draw awareness into the body.

### Belly Breathing for Grounding:
1. Breathe deep into belly
2. Feel the belly expand
3. Feel the belly contract
4. Continue slowly
5. Let breath anchor you in body

### Breath into Earth:
1. Inhale, imagine drawing breath up from earth through feet
2. Exhale, send breath down through feet into earth
3. Feel connection to ground with each breath

---

## Grounding Through Weight

Feeling gravity and weight helps ground.

### The Practice:
1. Feel your weight in the seat/floor
2. Let gravity pull you down
3. Stop resisting the pull
4. Let yourself be heavy
5. Feel supported by what's beneath you

### Why It Works:
- Engages proprioception
- Creates felt sense of support
- Counters "floating" sensation
- Brings awareness down

## Physical Grounding

Movement can ground effectively.

### Techniques:
- **Stomping feet:** Feel impact with ground
- **Pushing against wall:** Feel strength and resistance
- **Holding ice:** Intense sensation brings presence
- **Cold water on face/hands:** Shocks awareness into body
- **Tapping body:** Brings attention to physical form
- **Walking barefoot:** Direct ground contact

### When to Use:
- When subtle practices aren't enough
- During intense activation
- When very dissociated
- When mind is extremely scattered

---

## Grounding Objects

Physical objects can help anchor you.

### Examples:
- Smooth stone to hold
- Textured fabric
- Stress ball
- Keys or coins
- Anything with distinct sensation

### How to Use:
- Hold the object
- Focus on its texture, weight, temperature
- Let sensations anchor you

## The Ground Exercise

A more extended grounding practice.

### Steps:
1. Sit or stand comfortably
2. Feel feet on floor
3. Imagine roots growing down from feet into earth
4. Roots extend deep into the ground
5. Draw energy and stability up through roots
6. Feel supported by the earth
7. Let tension drain down through roots
8. Rest in this grounded connection

### Duration:
5-10 minutes for full practice. Brief version: 30 seconds imagining roots.

<Exercise title="Root Visualization">

Practice the root visualization for 5 minutes.

<Journal
  id="roots-practice"
  prompt="After the root visualization, what do you notice? How does your body feel? What's your mental state?"
  placeholder="Body feels:&#10;&#10;Mental state:&#10;&#10;What I noticed:"

## Daily Grounding

Make grounding a regular practice, not just crisis intervention.

### Grounding Moments:
- Upon waking (feel bed, then feet on floor)
- Before meals (feel body before eating)
- Transitions (between activities)
- Before conversations (ground before engaging)
- Before sleep (settle into bed fully)

### Building the Habit:
- Link to existing routines
- Set reminders
- Brief is fine (30 seconds counts)
- Consistency over duration
