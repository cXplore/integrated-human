## Shame in Action

Shame doesn't just sit dormant. It creates patterns—predictable ways it shows up in your life.

Learning to recognize these patterns is essential. You can't change what you can't see.

**Your shame patterns are not character flaws. They're survival strategies built on a false premise.**

---

## The Core Shame Strategies

When shame is active, we develop strategies to manage it:

### 1. Hiding / Withdrawal
If they can't see me, they can't reject me.

### 2. Perfectionism
If I'm perfect, I'll be acceptable.

### 3. People-Pleasing
If they like me, I must be okay.

### 4. Numbing
If I can't feel it, it doesn't hurt.

### 5. Attack Self
If I beat myself up first, it hurts less when others do.

### 6. Attack Others
If I'm dominant/superior, I'm not the defective one.

### 7. Overachieving
If I achieve enough, I'll prove my worth.

<Exercise title="Your Triggers">

<Journal
  id="shame-triggers"
  prompt="What triggers your shame? What situations, words, or experiences activate it? What sends you into shame spiral?"
  placeholder="Situations that trigger my shame:&#10;&#10;Words or phrases that trigger it:&#10;&#10;What sends me into shame spiral:&#10;&#10;What's happening when shame hits:"

## The Shame Spiral

### What It Looks Like:
1. Trigger activates shame
2. Shame produces negative thoughts
3. Thoughts intensify shame
4. More thoughts, more shame
5. Behavioral response (hiding, numbing, etc.)
6. More shame about the response
7. Deeper spiral

### Breaking the Spiral:
The goal is to interrupt at any point—recognize what's happening, bring compassion, break the pattern.

---

## Shame in Relationships

### How Shame Affects Relating:
- Can't be vulnerable (fear of rejection)
- Push people away (before they leave)
- Choose unavailable partners (confirm unworthiness)
- Accept poor treatment (don't deserve better)
- Sabotage good things (can't let in love)

### The Paradox:
Shame makes us need connection AND push it away.

- Chronic body tension

*Your patterns aren't weaknesses. They're creative adaptations to an impossible situation. The child who felt defective developed strategies to survive. Now those strategies can be updated—not with shame about having them, but with compassion for what they were trying to do.*
