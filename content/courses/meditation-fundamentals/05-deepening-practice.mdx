## Beyond Fundamentals

You now have the foundation: core techniques, working with obstacles, and building the habit.

This module explores what's next—how to deepen and develop your practice over time.

**Meditation isn't a destination. It's an ongoing exploration.**

## Signs of Progress

Progress in meditation is often subtle. Look for:

### In Practice:
- Noticing wandering sooner
- Longer periods of focus
- More comfort sitting
- Less fighting with experience
- Greater stability

### In Daily Life:
- More present in conversations
- Less reactive to stress
- Noticing thoughts before acting on them
- Greater emotional awareness
- More ease and spaciousness

### What's NOT Progress:
- Expecting special states
- Measuring by how "good" sessions feel
- Comparing to others
- Achieving a "quiet mind"

**Progress is often invisible until you look back.**

## Final Words

You now have everything you need to build a meditation practice. The only thing left is to practice.

Not perfectly. Not intensively. Just regularly.

Show up. Sit down. Follow your breath. Return when you wander. Again and again.

That's it. That's the whole practice.

*Meditation is simple, but not easy. Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Keep practicing.*
