## The Foundation

Most meditation traditions share core techniques. Master these, and you have the foundation for any practice.

In this module, you'll learn:
1. **Breath Awareness:** Following the breath
2. **Body Scanning:** Systematic attention to sensations
3. **Noting:** Mental labeling for awareness

**These aren't competing techniques—they're complementary tools.**

---

## Setting Up

Before any technique, establish these basics:

### Posture:
- Sit comfortably (chair, cushion, bench)
- Spine relatively straight (not rigid)
- Shoulders relaxed
- Hands resting naturally
- Head level, chin slightly tucked

### Eyes:
- Closed, or softly open looking downward
- Find what works for you

### Time:
- Set a timer (5-20 minutes to start)
- Commit to the full time

### Attitude:
- Relaxed but alert
- Patient, not forcing
- Curious, not judgmental

---

## Technique 1: Breath Awareness

The most fundamental meditation practice.

### How to Do It:

1. **Find the breath:**
   - Notice where you feel breath most clearly
   - Options: nostrils, chest, belly
   - Choose one location

2. **Rest attention there:**
   - Feel the sensations of breathing
   - In-breath, out-breath
   - Don't control the breath—observe it

3. **When mind wanders:**
   - Notice it has wandered
   - No judgment ("I suck at this")
   - Gently return to breath
   - That return IS the practice

4. **Repeat:**
   - Mind wanders, you return
   - Over and over
   - That's the whole practice

### Tips:
- You don't need to breathe deeply—natural breath
- The wandering-and-returning is normal, not failure
- Each return strengthens the attention muscle

<Exercise title="Breath Awareness Practice">

Try a 5-minute breath awareness practice right now.

Set a timer. Sit comfortably. Find your breath. Follow it. Return when you wander.

<Journal
  id="breath-practice-1"
  prompt="After your 5-minute practice, what did you notice? How many times did your mind wander? What was the experience like?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;How often my mind wandered:&#10;&#10;What the experience was like:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Technique 2: Body Scanning

Systematic attention to physical sensations.

### How to Do It:

1. **Start at one end:**
   - Usually feet or head
   - Choose consistently

2. **Move attention through body:**
   - Small region by small region
   - Notice sensations in each area
   - Tingling, pressure, warmth, nothing—all valid

3. **Stay curious:**
   - What's actually here?
   - Not what "should" be—what IS
   - Explore with interest

4. **Move on:**
   - Don't force sensations
   - If nothing, note that and move on
   - Systematic, thorough

5. **Return when wandering:**
   - Notice where you were
   - Come back to that spot
   - Continue scanning

### Benefits:
- Develops body awareness
- Grounding and calming
- Catches tension you're holding
- Useful before sleep

<Exercise title="Body Scan Practice">

Try a body scan. Start at your feet. Slowly move up through each body part. Notice sensations.

<Journal
  id="body-scan-1"
  prompt="After your body scan, what did you notice? Where did you feel sensations most? Where was there no sensation?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;Where I felt sensation:&#10;&#10;Where there was no sensation:&#10;&#10;What surprised me:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Technique 3: Noting

Mental labeling to maintain awareness.

### How to Do It:

1. **Establish awareness:**
   - Start with breath or open awareness
   - Notice what arises

2. **Briefly label:**
   - When something arises, give it a simple label
   - Thinking, feeling, hearing, sensing
   - One or two words, softly noted

3. **Return to awareness:**
   - Don't elaborate on the note
   - Just label and return
   - Keep it light and quick

### Examples:
- A thought arises → "thinking"
- You hear a sound → "hearing"
- You feel itchy → "sensation"
- Anxiety arises → "anxiety" or "feeling"
- You're planning → "thinking" or "planning"

### Tips:
- Notes should be brief, not elaborate
- 1-2 words maximum
- The note maintains awareness
- Helps prevent getting lost in content

---

<Exercise title="Noting Practice">

Try noting for 5 minutes. Follow your breath. When anything arises, briefly note it: "thinking," "hearing," "sensation." Return to breath.

<Journal
  id="noting-practice-1"
  prompt="After your noting practice, what did you notice? What notes arose most frequently? How did noting affect your experience?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;Most common notes:&#10;&#10;How noting affected my experience:"
  rows={6}

## Combining Techniques

You can combine these techniques:

### Examples:
- Breath awareness as primary, with noting when distracted
- Body scan to settle, then breath awareness
- Noting as your primary practice

### What Works for You:
Experiment. Different techniques suit different temperaments and situations.

## Common Mistakes

### Trying Too Hard:
- Meditation is effortful but not forced
- Straining creates tension
- Relax into the practice

### Expecting Immediate Results:
- Progress is gradual
- Some sessions feel productive, some don't
- Keep practicing regardless

### Fighting Thoughts:
- Don't try to suppress thoughts
- Let them arise and pass
- Just don't follow them

### Harsh Self-Judgment:
- Noticing you wandered IS the practice
- Don't berate yourself
- Gently, patiently return

---

## Building Your Practice

### Suggested Progression:

**Week 1-2:**
- 5 minutes daily
- Breath awareness only
- Focus on consistency

**Week 3-4:**
- 10 minutes daily
- Add noting if helpful
- Continue building habit

**Week 5+:**
- 15-20 minutes
- Experiment with techniques
- Body scan for variety

## Key Concepts

- **Breath Awareness:** Following the breath, returning when distracted.

- **The Core Pattern:** Attention wanders → notice → return → repeat.

- **Effort Level:** Effortful but not forced—relaxed alertness.

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll learn to work with common obstacles—restlessness, sleepiness, doubt, and distraction. Every meditator faces these.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice at least 3 times with the techniques learned
- Find which technique feels most natural
- Build the beginning of your routine

---

*The technique matters less than the practice. What matters is that you do it—consistently, patiently, returning again and again.*
