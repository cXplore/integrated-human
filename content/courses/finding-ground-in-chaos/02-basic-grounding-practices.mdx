## The Practices

These are foundational grounding techniques. They're simple—intentionally so. In crisis, simple is all we can manage.

Try each one. Notice what works for you. Different practices work for different people and different moments.

---

## Practice 1: Feet on Floor

The simplest grounding practice.

**How:**
1. Feel your feet on the ground
2. Press down slightly
3. Notice the contact—the floor pressing back against your feet
4. Stay here for a few breaths

**Why it works:**
You're literally feeling the ground. You're standing on something solid. Gravity is holding you to the Earth.

## Practice 2: 5-4-3-2-1 Senses

A classic for acute moments.

**How:**
Name out loud (or silently):
- **5** things you can see
- **4** things you can touch/feel
- **3** things you can hear
- **2** things you can smell
- **1** thing you can taste

**Why it works:**
Engages all five senses, forcing attention into the present moment. Hard to spin in thoughts when you're cataloging reality.

---

## Practice 3: Hands Awareness

Attention to one body part.

**How:**
1. Notice your hands
2. Feel them from the inside—the aliveness in them
3. Notice their temperature, any tingling, the weight of them
4. Gently open and close them
5. Press fingertips together

**Why it works:**
Hands are rich with nerve endings—lots of sensation to notice. Easy to access, always with you.

---

## Practice 4: Touch Something Real

External anchoring through contact.

**How:**
1. Find an object nearby
2. Touch it deliberately
3. Notice everything about it: texture, temperature, weight
4. Stay with the sensation for several breaths

**Why it works:**
Creates concrete contact with physical reality. You're here, touching this thing, in this place.

---

<Exercise title="Touch Something">

Find an object and try this practice.

<Journal
  id="fgic-touch"
  prompt="Touch something nearby. Really feel it.

What object did you choose?
What do you notice about its texture, temperature, weight?
What is it like to give it your full attention?"
  placeholder="I chose to touch...

I noticed..."
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Practice 5: Temperature Grounding

Using temperature to anchor.

**How:**
- Cold water on wrists or face
- Ice cube held in palm
- Warm cup held in hands
- Feel the air temperature on your skin

**Why it works:**
Temperature is impossible to ignore. It demands attention. Cuts through dissociation and spinning.

---

## Practice 6: Body Scan (Short)

Quick scan of physical sensation.

**How:**
1. Move attention through your body from feet to head
2. Just notice what's there—no need to change anything
3. Tight areas, relaxed areas, numb areas—all okay
4. Take about 30 seconds total

**Why it works:**
Gives your nervous system the message: "I'm aware of my body, I'm attending to it, I'm here."

---

## Practice 7: Hold Your Own Hands

Self-contact for settling.

**How:**
1. Hold your own hand as you would a friend's
2. Notice the warmth
3. Give a gentle squeeze
4. You're holding yourself

**Why it works:**
Touch releases oxytocin. Self-touch counts. You're providing yourself comfort.

<Callout type="gentle">
You don't need to do these perfectly. You don't need to feel dramatically different. Just do them. Even imperfect grounding helps.
</Callout>

---

## Practice 8: Press and Release

Using muscle engagement.

**How:**
1. Press your palms together firmly for 5 seconds
2. Release suddenly
3. Notice the sensation in your hands afterward
4. Repeat with other muscles: clench fists, push against a wall

**Why it works:**
Muscle engagement followed by release creates noticeable sensation. Good for when you feel numb or disconnected.

---

<Exercise title="Press and Release">

Try pressing palms together.

<Journal
  id="fgic-press"
  prompt="Press your palms together firmly for 5 seconds.
Then release suddenly and notice.

What do you feel in your hands after releasing?
Try it with clenched fists too if you like."
  placeholder="After pressing, I noticed..."
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

---

## Practice 9: Heavy Blanket or Weight

Using pressure to settle.

**How:**
1. Wrap yourself in a heavy blanket
2. Or place something weighted on your lap (pillow, pet, bag)
3. Notice the pressure against your body
4. Let it hold you

**Why it works:**
Deep pressure is calming to the nervous system. It's why weighted blankets help with anxiety.

---

## Practice 10: Orienting

Looking around deliberately.

**How:**
1. Slowly look around the room
2. Really see what's there
3. Name objects if it helps ("There's a lamp. There's a window.")
4. Move your head and eyes, taking it in

**Why it works:**
In survival mode, we tunnel vision. Deliberately looking around signals safety—you're not under attack.

---

## Finding Your Go-To

Not every practice will resonate. That's normal.

Try them. Notice which ones help. Those become your go-to practices.

You might have:
- One for panic (temperature, 5-4-3-2-1)
- One for dissociation (press and release, touch)
- One for everyday steadiness (feet on floor, hands awareness)
