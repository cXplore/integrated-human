## When the Mind Can't Help

In crisis, the mind often makes things worse:

- It races with worst-case scenarios
- It replays what went wrong
- It catastrophizes the future
- It spirals into panic or despair

You can't think your way out of crisis. The thinking brain is offline when the alarm system is firing.

But your body is still here. And it can be your anchor.

---

## The Body as Safe Harbor

Your body is always present. Always now. Always here.

When thoughts spin into the future or past, the body remains in this moment:
- Your feet are touching the ground now
- Your breath is happening now
- Your heartbeat is now, now, now

This is why body-based practices work when nothing else does. They bring you back to the only place you can actually be: here.

## Why Grounding Works

When you feel the physical world—the floor beneath you, the weight of your body, the temperature of the air—something happens:

1. **Attention shifts** from thoughts to sensation
2. **The nervous system gets data:** "I have a body, I'm somewhere, I'm safe enough"
3. **The survival alarm can begin to quiet** because you're demonstrating that you're here, now, not in the feared future or painful past

Grounding isn't about feeling better. It's about feeling present. And presence is where we find stability.

Grounding doesn't solve problems or make pain disappear. It creates a stable platform to feel from. A place to stand while the storm rages.

## The Present Moment Is Usually Safe

Here's a strange truth: in this exact moment, you're usually okay.

The crisis might be real. The pain might be real. The future might be uncertain.

But right now—this second—you're here. Reading these words. Breathing. Your body is doing what it does.

Most of what hurts us is past (memories, losses) or future (fears, anticipations). The present moment itself is often survivable.

Grounding helps you find that present moment.

## Your Body Knows How

You don't have to learn to be in your body. Your body already knows how to be here.

The practices in this course aren't techniques you add. They're reminders to notice what's already happening:
- You're already breathing
- You're already touching something
- You're already in a physical space

We're just going to turn attention toward that. Let it anchor you.

<Exercise title="Right Now">

Try this simple awareness.

<Journal
  id="fgic-rightnow"
  prompt="Right now, without changing anything:

• What surface is your body touching?
• What temperature do you notice?
• Where is your breath right now?
• What sounds exist in this moment?

Just notice. You don't have to do anything with this information."
  placeholder="Right now I notice..."

## What "Grounded" Feels Like

Grounding isn't a dramatic experience. It often feels like:

- Slightly more present
- A bit less spinning
- More aware of your body
- Somewhat steadier
- Like you're "here"

It's subtle. You might barely notice it. But even subtle grounding helps.

---

## This Isn't About Feeling Good

I want to be clear: grounding isn't about making you feel good or happy.

You might ground yourself and still feel terrible. You might feel the floor beneath you and still be in despair.

That's okay. The goal isn't to feel better. The goal is to feel *here*. To have a stable place to stand, even if that place is painful.

## What's Coming

This course will teach you:

- **Basic grounding practices** — Simple ways to anchor in your body
- **What to do when the body feels unsafe** — For when physical sensation is triggering
- **Daily anchors** — Small practices to weave into everyday life

Nothing complicated. Nothing that requires you to be in any particular state. Just simple ways to find ground.
