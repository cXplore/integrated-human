## Speaking Your Truth

Speaking authentically means expressing what's real for you—your feelings, needs, and experiences—without attacking, blaming, or making the other person wrong.

This is harder than it sounds. Most people either:
- Suppress truth to avoid conflict
- Express truth as attack

**The skill is finding the middle path: honest AND kind. True AND connecting.**

---

## The Formula for Authentic Expression

### The Structure:

1. **Observation:** What happened (facts, not interpretation)
2. **Feeling:** What you feel about it (emotion words)
3. **Need:** The underlying need connected to the feeling
4. **Request:** What you'd like (specific, actionable)

### Example:

**Instead of:** "You never listen to me!"

**Try:** "When I share something and you look at your phone (observation), I feel dismissed and unimportant (feeling), because I need to feel like what I say matters to you (need). Would you be willing to put your phone down when I'm telling you something important? (request)"

---

## Step 1: Observation vs. Judgment

### Judgments (Interpretations):
- "You always..."
- "You never..."
- "You're being so..."
- "You don't care about..."
- "You're selfish/inconsiderate/cold"

### Observations (Facts):
- "When you came home two hours late..."
- "When I asked you about your day and you said 'fine'..."
- "When I hear that tone of voice..."
- "When you checked your phone during dinner..."

**Observations describe what a camera would see/record. Judgments are your interpretation.**

### The Test:
Could you play back video of it? If yes, it's observation. If no, it's judgment.

---

## Step 2: Feelings vs. Thoughts

We often say "I feel like..." and then express a thought, not a feeling.

### Not Feelings:
- "I feel like you don't care" (thought about them)
- "I feel that you're being unfair" (judgment)
- "I feel like I'm always the one who..." (story)
- "I feel abandoned" (interpretation of their behavior)

### Actual Feelings:
- Hurt
- Scared
- Sad
- Angry
- Frustrated
- Anxious
- Lonely
- Disappointed
- Confused
- Overwhelmed

**Use emotion words, not interpretations of what they did.**

---

## Feelings Vocabulary

Expand your emotional vocabulary:

### When Needs Are Met:
- Grateful, appreciative, thankful
- Joyful, happy, delighted
- Peaceful, calm, content
- Excited, enthusiastic, alive
- Confident, secure, empowered
- Connected, loving, warm
- Hopeful, optimistic, encouraged

### When Needs Are Unmet:
- Sad, hurt, disappointed
- Anxious, worried, scared
- Angry, frustrated, irritated
- Lonely, disconnected, isolated
- Confused, uncertain, lost
- Exhausted, depleted, overwhelmed
- Embarrassed, ashamed, exposed
- Resentful, bitter, betrayed

<Exercise title="Feelings Practice">

<Journal
  id="feelings-recent"
  prompt="Think of a recent difficult interaction. What did you feel? List at least 5 specific emotion words (not 'upset' or 'bad')."
  placeholder="I felt:&#10;1.&#10;2.&#10;3.&#10;4.&#10;5."
  rows={7}
/>

<Journal
  id="judgment-to-feeling"
  prompt="Convert these judgments to feelings:
• 'I feel like you don't respect me' → I feel ___
• 'I feel abandoned' → I feel ___
• 'I feel attacked' → I feel ___"
  placeholder="'You don't respect me' → I feel...&#10;&#10;'Abandoned' → I feel...&#10;&#10;'Attacked' → I feel..."
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Step 3: Needs

Beneath every feeling is an unmet need. Needs are universal—everyone has them.

### Core Human Needs:
- **Connection:** Love, belonging, intimacy, understanding, acceptance
- **Autonomy:** Freedom, choice, independence, space
- **Meaning:** Purpose, contribution, growth, mattering
- **Safety:** Security, predictability, trust, stability
- **Respect:** Recognition, appreciation, being valued
- **Honesty:** Authenticity, integrity, truth

### Connecting Feelings to Needs:

| Feeling | Possible Unmet Need |
|---------|---------------------|
| Lonely | Connection |
| Trapped | Autonomy |
| Hurt | Respect, care |
| Anxious | Safety, predictability |
| Angry | Fairness, respect |
| Sad | Connection, understanding |

---

## Needs vs. Strategies

A **need** is universal. A **strategy** is how you try to meet it.

### Example:
- **Need:** Connection
- **Strategies:** Daily phone calls, quality time, physical touch, words of affirmation

The problem: We often demand specific strategies when other strategies might meet the same need.

**"I need you to call me every day"** → Strategy
**"I need to feel connected to you"** → Need

When you identify the need, you open space for creative solutions.

---

## Step 4: Requests

A request is different from a demand.

### Requests vs. Demands:
- **Request:** You're genuinely open to "no" as an answer
- **Demand:** "No" will result in punishment, withdrawal, or anger

### Making Requests:
- Be specific (not "be more attentive" but "would you put your phone away when we talk?")
- Be actionable (something they can actually do)
- Be positive (what you want, not what you don't want)
- Include timeline if relevant

### Examples:
- "Would you be willing to..."
- "I'd like to ask if you'd..."
- "Would you consider..."
- "How would you feel about..."

<Exercise title="The Formula in Practice">

Think of something you want to communicate to someone.

<Journal
  id="formula-observation"
  prompt="What is the observation? (Just the facts—what would a camera record?)"
  placeholder="When I..."
  rows={3}
/>

<Journal
  id="formula-feeling"
  prompt="What do you feel? (Use emotion words, not judgments)"
  placeholder="I feel..."
  rows={3}
/>

<Journal
  id="formula-need"
  prompt="What need is connected to this feeling?"
  placeholder="Because I need..."
  rows={3}
/>

<Journal
  id="formula-request"
  prompt="What is your specific, actionable request?"
  placeholder="Would you be willing to..."
  rows={3}
/>

<Journal
  id="formula-complete"
  prompt="Now write the complete statement:"
  placeholder="When you... I feel... because I need... Would you be willing to..."
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Owning Your Experience

Authentic speaking means taking responsibility for your inner experience.

### Ownership Language:
- "I feel..." (not "You make me feel...")
- "My interpretation is..." (not "The truth is...")
- "The story I'm telling myself is..." (not "Obviously, you...")
- "I'm triggered by..." (not "You triggered me")

### Examples:
**Blaming:** "You made me feel worthless."
**Owning:** "When you said that, I felt worthless."

**Blaming:** "You're impossible to talk to."
**Owning:** "I notice I get frustrated in conversations with you."

---

## When You're Triggered

Even with good intentions, you'll sometimes speak from reactivity. Here's what helps:

### Before Speaking:
1. **Pause** - Buy time ("Let me think about this")
2. **Breathe** - Regulate your nervous system
3. **Check** - What am I actually feeling? What do I actually want?
4. **Choose** - Is this the right time to speak?

### If You Mess Up:
- Acknowledge it quickly
- "I didn't say that how I meant to"
- "Can I try that again?"
- "That came out wrong"
- Return to authentic expression

---

## Things That Kill Authentic Communication

### The Four Horsemen (Gottman):
1. **Criticism:** "You always..." "You never..." (attacking character)
2. **Contempt:** Eye-rolling, sarcasm, mockery (superiority)
3. **Defensiveness:** "I only did that because you..." (not taking responsibility)
4. **Stonewalling:** Shutting down, withdrawing completely

### Other Killers:
- Sarcasm
- Mind-reading ("I know you're thinking...")
- Absolutes ("always," "never")
- Name-calling
- Bringing up old grievances
- Kitchen-sinking (everything at once)

<Exercise title="Converting Attacks to Authenticity">

<Journal
  id="convert-attack1"
  prompt="Convert this attack to authentic expression:
'You're so selfish! You only think about yourself!'"
  placeholder="Observation:&#10;&#10;Feeling:&#10;&#10;Need:&#10;&#10;Request:"
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="convert-attack2"
  prompt="Convert this:
'Why don't you ever help around here? I have to do everything!'"
  placeholder="Observation:&#10;&#10;Feeling:&#10;&#10;Need:&#10;&#10;Request:"
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="convert-own"
  prompt="Think of something you've said (or wanted to say) as an attack. Convert it to authentic expression."
  placeholder="The attack version:&#10;&#10;The authentic version:&#10;&#10;Observation:&#10;Feeling:&#10;Need:&#10;Request:"
  rows={10}
/>

## The Courage to Be Vulnerable

Authentic speaking requires vulnerability. Sharing what you actually feel is scary because:
- You might be rejected
- They might not care
- You're exposed
- You can't control their response

**But without vulnerability, there's no real connection.**

Saying "I'm hurt" is harder than saying "You're being a jerk." But only one creates connection.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Observation:** What actually happened, free of interpretation. What a camera would record.

- **Needs:** Universal human requirements (connection, autonomy, respect, etc.) that underlie feelings.

- **Request vs. Demand:** A request is open to "no." A demand punishes the "no."

- **Ownership Language:** Taking responsibility for your experience rather than blaming.

- **Vulnerability:** Sharing what's real, even when it's scary.

---

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll learn the other half of communication—listening deeply. Speaking authentically only works if the other person feels heard. You'll learn how to receive in ways that create safety for authentic expression.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice the formula in low-stakes situations
- Notice when you're tempted to attack vs. speak authentically
- Build your feelings vocabulary

---

*Speaking your truth doesn't mean saying whatever you think. It means expressing what's real inside you in a way that honors both yourself and the other person.*
