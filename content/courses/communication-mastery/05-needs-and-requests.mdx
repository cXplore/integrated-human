## The Problem with Unspoken Needs

Most relationship dissatisfaction comes from unmet needs. But here's the problem:

**Most people don't know what they need, don't ask for it, then resent others for not providing it.**

We expect mind-reading. We drop hints. We criticize what we don't want instead of asking for what we do. Then we're disappointed when our needs go unmet.

---

## Why We Don't Ask

### Fear of Rejection:
"What if they say no?"
"It will confirm I'm too needy."

### Fear of Being a Burden:
"I should be able to handle this myself."
"They have their own problems."

### Belief That We Shouldn't Have to:
"If they loved me, they'd know."
"I shouldn't have to ask."

### Not Knowing What We Need:
"I don't even know what would help."
"Something's wrong, but I can't name it."

---

## The Cost of Not Asking

When you don't ask for what you need:
- Needs go unmet (obviously)
- Resentment builds
- You feel invisible
- Distance grows
- You might get it elsewhere (affairs, etc.)
- Relationship erodes

**The person can't meet needs they don't know about.**

---

## Step 1: Know What You Need

You can't ask for what you don't know you need.

<Journal

  prompt="What needs feel most unmet in your life or relationships right now? Be specific about what's missing."
  placeholder="The needs I'm most lacking:&#10;&#10;What's specifically missing:&#10;&#10;How this affects me:"

## Step 2: Distinguish Needs from Strategies

A **need** is universal. Everyone has it.
A **strategy** is one specific way to meet that need.

### Examples:

| Need | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| Connection | Daily phone calls |
| Appreciation | Verbal praise |
| Autonomy | Weekly solo time |
| Safety | Knowing the schedule |
| Fun | Traveling together |

### Why This Matters:

If you demand a specific strategy, you limit options. The other person might be willing to meet the need through a different strategy.

**Wrong:** "I need you to call me every day" (strategy as demand)
**Better:** "I need to feel connected. Would daily calls work for you, or is there another way we could stay connected?" (need + flexible strategy)

---

## Step 3: Make Effective Requests

A request is how you ask for your needs to be met.

### Effective Requests Are:

**Specific:**
Not "I need you to be more supportive"
But "Would you be willing to listen without giving advice when I share work stress?"

**Actionable:**
Not "I need you to care more"
But "Would you be willing to ask about my day when you get home?"

**Positive:**
Not "Stop ignoring me"
But "Would you put your phone away during dinner?"

**Doable:**
Not "I need you to never be late"
But "Would you be willing to text me if you're running more than 10 minutes late?"

---

## Request vs. Demand

### The Difference:
A **request** is genuinely open to "no."
A **demand** punishes "no" with anger, guilt, or withdrawal.

### Check Yourself:
If they say no, what will you do?
- If you'll be disappointed but understanding → request
- If you'll punish, withdraw, or guilt them → demand

### Demands Don't Work:
Even if they comply, it's not freely given. Resentment builds. Connection erodes.

<Exercise title="Crafting Requests">

For one unmet need you identified:

<Journal
  id="need-statement"
  prompt="What is the underlying need? (Universal need, not specific strategy)"
  placeholder="My underlying need is..."
  rows={2}
/>

<Journal
  id="strategy-options"
  prompt="What are 3 different strategies that could meet this need?"
  placeholder="1.&#10;&#10;2.&#10;&#10;3."
  rows={6}
/>

<Journal
  id="specific-request"
  prompt="Write a specific, actionable, positive request:"
  placeholder="Would you be willing to..."
  rows={3}
/>

<Journal
  id="no-response"
  prompt="How will you respond if they say no? (Check: is this a request or a demand?)"
  placeholder="If they say no, I will..."
  rows={4}
/>

</Exercise>

## The Full Formula

Putting it together:

1. **Observation:** When [specific situation]...
2. **Feeling:** I feel [emotion]...
3. **Need:** Because I need [universal need]...
4. **Request:** Would you be willing to [specific, actionable, positive request]?

### Example:

"When you work late without telling me (observation), I feel worried and disconnected (feeling), because I need to know you're safe and I want to feel connected to you (need). Would you be willing to text me when you're going to be more than an hour late? (request)"

---

## Asking Without Attack

The way you ask determines how it's received.

### Attack Mode (Don't):
- "You never..."
- "Why can't you just..."
- "If you really loved me, you'd..."
- Blaming, shaming tone
- Already angry when asking

### Request Mode (Do):
- Calm, regulated state
- Ownership of your experience
- Non-blaming language
- Open to dialogue
- Curious about their response

**Same request, different delivery → completely different outcome.**

---

## Receiving "No"

What to do when they say no:

### Don't:
- Punish (proving it was a demand)
- Guilt trip
- Withdraw affection
- Bring it up repeatedly
- Conclude they don't care

### Do:
- Accept the no (it's information)
- Get curious: "Can you tell me more about what's hard about this?"
- Explore alternatives: "Is there another way that would work better for you?"
- Express feeling without blaming: "I feel disappointed, and I want to find something that works for both of us."
- Negotiate or revisit later

---

## When They Have Needs Too

Remember: they also have needs. Good relationships involve:
- Both people knowing their needs
- Both people asking
- Both people responding
- Ongoing negotiation
- No one always sacrificing

### Watch for:
- Always prioritizing their needs over yours
- Never asking for what you need
- Resentment building from imbalance
- One-way giving

---

<Exercise title="Balancing Needs in Relationship">

Think about a key relationship.

<Journal
  id="balance-mine"
  prompt="What are your main needs in this relationship? Are they being met?"
  placeholder="My main needs:&#10;&#10;Are they being met?"
  rows={5}
/>

<Journal
  id="balance-theirs"
  prompt="What are their main needs? Are you meeting them?"
  placeholder="Their main needs:&#10;&#10;Am I meeting them?"
  rows={5}
/>

<Journal
  id="balance-assessment"
  prompt="How balanced is the give and take of needs in this relationship? What might need to shift?"
  placeholder="The balance is...&#10;&#10;What might need to shift:"
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

## Asking for Hard Things

Some requests feel too vulnerable:
- "I need more physical affection"
- "I need you to initiate sex sometimes"
- "I need more emotional support"
- "I need you to prioritize our relationship"

### Making Hard Requests:

**Acknowledge the vulnerability:**
"This is hard for me to ask for..."

**Own your part:**
"I know I haven't communicated this clearly before..."

**Be specific but kind:**
State what you need without attacking their past failure to provide it.

**Give them room:**
Allow them to respond without immediate judgment.

---

## Building a Culture of Asking

The goal is a relationship where both people:
- Know asking is safe
- Ask directly
- Receive requests non-defensively
- Say yes when they can
- Say no when they need to
- Negotiate collaboratively

### This Requires:
- Rewarding requests (not punishing them)
- Making it safe to say no
- Following through on yes
- Checking in regularly
- Assuming good intent

---

## Key Concepts

- **Needs:** Universal human requirements like connection, autonomy, meaning, safety.

- **Strategies:** Specific ways to meet needs. Many strategies can meet the same need.

- **Request vs. Demand:** A request is genuinely open to "no." A demand punishes it.

- **Specific and Positive:** Effective requests are specific, actionable, and state what you want (not what you don't want).

- **Receiving No:** How you handle "no" reveals whether it was a request or demand.

## What's Next

In Module 6, you'll learn about repair conversations—how to come back after communication breaks down. Because it will break down, and the ability to repair is what determines relationship health.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify one need you haven't been asking for
- Craft a specific request using the formula
- Practice asking in a low-stakes situation

---

*The people who get their needs met are the people who ask. There's no prize for suffering in silence.*
