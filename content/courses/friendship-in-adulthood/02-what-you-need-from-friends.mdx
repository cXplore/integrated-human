## Quantity vs. Quality

### How Many Friends?

Research suggests:
- 3-5 close friends is typical and healthy
- Many acquaintances is also valuable
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Different friends serve different functions

### The Friendship Portfolio

Consider having:
- 1-3 close/intimate friends (deep connection)
- A wider circle of good friends (regular contact)
- Acquaintances and casual friends (breadth)

You don't need many close friends. You do need some.

### What Works for You

Some people:
- Thrive with many connections
- Prefer just a few deep relationships
- Need variety in friend types
- Are satisfied with smaller circles

There's no right number. What matters is that you're fulfilled.

## Friendship Values

### What Matters to You

Consider what you value in friendship:
- Honesty and directness
- Loyalty and reliability
- Fun and spontaneity
- Deep conversation
- Shared activities
- Emotional attunement
- Independence and space
- Consistency and predictability

### Compatibility Matters

Good friendships often share:
- Similar values
- Compatible communication styles
- Mutual respect
- Balanced reciprocity
- Space for differences

### Dealbreakers

What doesn't work for you:
- Certain behaviors
- Value clashes
- Communication patterns
- Reliability issues

Knowing what doesn't work helps you choose well.

## Different Friends for Different Things

### It's Okay to Have Specialized Friends

Not every friend serves every need:
- The friend you go deep with
- The friend you have fun with
- The friend who challenges you
- The friend you work out with
- The friend who knows your history

### Expecting One Person to Be Everything

The problem:
- No one can meet all your needs
- Putting all eggs in one basket
- Overburdening individual friendships

The solution:
- Multiple friendships serving different functions
- Appropriate expectations for each
- A portfolio of connections

### The Exception

Close friends often serve multiple needs:
- Deep, multi-dimensional connection
- Multiple functions in one relationship
- These are rare and precious

But even best friends don't fulfill everything.

## Life Stages and Friendship

### Friendship Needs Change

Different life stages bring different needs:
- Young adulthood: adventure, identity formation
- New parenthood: practical support, shared experience
- Mid-life: deeper connection, meaning
- Later life: companionship, mutual care

### When Life Changes

Major transitions affect friendship:
- Moving to a new place
- Having children
- Career changes
- Divorce or loss
- Health changes

Needs shift. Friendships may need to shift too.

<Callout type="important">
Understanding what you need from friendship isn't being picky—it's being intentional. When you know what you're looking for, you can build connections that actually fulfill you rather than just accumulating acquaintances.
</Callout>

*The best friendships happen when you know what you need and find people who need what you offer.*
