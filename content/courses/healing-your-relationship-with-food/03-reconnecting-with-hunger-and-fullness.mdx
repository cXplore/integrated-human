## The Lost Signals

Your body has a brilliant system for regulating food intake:

- **Hunger** signals when you need fuel
- **Fullness** signals when you've had enough
- **Satisfaction** signals when you're truly nourished

These signals work automatically—in babies, in animals, in humans who haven't been disconnected from them.

But dieting, emotional eating, and ignoring the body can muffle these signals. This module is about finding them again.

---

## What Went Wrong

The signals get disrupted when:

- **We override hunger:** "I'm hungry but I shouldn't eat." The body learns its signals are ignored.
- **We eat past fullness:** Whether from restriction backlash or emotional eating, the fullness signal gets overridden.
- **We eat by rules, not body:** External plans replace internal guidance.
- **We numb out:** Dissociation, distraction, speed-eating prevents noticing.

Over time, the signals get quieter. Not gone—just harder to hear.

Your hunger and fullness signals still exist. They may be faint or confusing, but they're there. With practice, you can strengthen them again.

## The Hunger-Fullness Scale

A useful tool is the 1-10 scale:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Starving, dizzy, desperate |
| 2 | Very hungry, irritable, low energy |
| 3 | Hungry, ready to eat |
| 4 | Slightly hungry |
| 5 | Neutral—not hungry, not full |
| 6 | Slightly satisfied |
| 7 | Comfortably satisfied |
| 8 | Full |
| 9 | Uncomfortably full |
| 10 | Stuffed, sick |

**The goal:** Start eating around 3-4, stop around 6-7.

Not as a strict rule—as a general guideline while you rebuild awareness.

## What Hunger Feels Like

Hunger shows up differently in different bodies. Common signals:

**Physical:**
- Stomach growling or emptiness
- Low energy
- Slight headache
- Difficulty concentrating
- Light-headedness

**Emotional/mental:**
- Thinking about food
- Irritability
- Difficulty focusing on other things

**Note:** If you've restricted for a long time, hunger might feel like anxiety, panic, or numbness. It takes time to relearn.

---

## What Fullness Feels Like

Fullness also has signals:

**Physical:**
- Stomach feels satisfied (not empty, not stretched)
- Energy returning
- Food becomes less appealing
- Eating slows down naturally

**Mental:**
- Able to think about other things
- Food loses its urgency
- "I could stop now"

**Satisfaction:**
- A sense of "enough"
- Not just physically full but genuinely satisfied
- The eating episode feels complete

---

## The Practice: Hunger-Fullness Check-Ins

To rebuild awareness, practice checking in:

**Before eating:**
- Pause for 10 seconds
- Ask: "Where am I on the scale?"
- Proceed

**Midway through eating:**
- Pause for 10 seconds
- Ask: "Where am I now?"
- Decide whether to continue

**After eating:**
- Pause for 10 seconds
- Ask: "Where did I end up?"
- No judgment, just data

<Exercise title="Practice Check-In">

Plan to practice check-ins at your next meal.

<Journal

  prompt="At your next meal, practice the check-in:

BEFORE EATING:
Where on the scale?

MIDWAY:
Where now?

AFTER:
Where did you end up?

What did you notice? (Complete this after the meal)"

## Satisfaction vs. Fullness

There's a difference between full and satisfied:

**Full:** Your stomach has food in it
**Satisfied:** You feel genuinely nourished and done

You can be full but not satisfied (ate enough volume but didn't enjoy it, or didn't eat what you really wanted).

You can be satisfied before you're stuffed (the food was exactly what you wanted, in the amount that felt right).

Aiming for satisfaction, not just fullness, is key.

---

## What Gets in the Way

Common blockers to hearing signals:

**Distracted eating:**
Eating while scrolling, watching, working means you're not noticing.

**Speed eating:**
Eating fast doesn't give signals time to register.

**"Clean your plate" conditioning:**
External cues override internal ones.

**Fear of hunger:**
If hunger feels dangerous, you might eat preemptively or eat past fullness "just in case."

**Emotional eating:**
When eating serves emotional purposes, hunger/fullness become irrelevant.

---

## Practical Steps

To reconnect:

### Eat without distraction (sometimes)
Not always—that's unrealistic. But sometimes, eat with just the food.

### Slow down (a little)
You don't have to eat glacially. Just not inhale.

### Check in
Before, during, after. Brief pauses.

### Notice what satisfies
What foods leave you genuinely satisfied? What's missing when you're full but not satisfied?

### Give it time
These signals strengthen with attention. It takes weeks to months.

<Callout type="gentle">
You won't do this perfectly. You'll eat past fullness sometimes. You'll not notice hunger sometimes. That's fine. The practice is in returning to awareness, not perfecting it.

## Key Ideas

- Hunger and fullness are natural signals that can get disrupted
- The signals are still there—just quieter
- The hunger-fullness scale (1-10) is a useful tool
- Check in before, during, and after eating
- Satisfaction is different from fullness—aim for satisfied
- Distraction, speed, conditioning, and emotions can block signals
- With practice, awareness strengthens over time
