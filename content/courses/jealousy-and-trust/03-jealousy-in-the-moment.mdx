## When It Hits

Jealousy doesn't announce itself calmly. It floods—suddenly you're in the grip of intense emotion, and reactive behavior feels inevitable.

This module is about what to do in those moments. Not how to never feel jealous—but how to feel it without letting it drive your actions.

---

## The Gap Between Feeling and Acting

There's a difference between:

**Feeling jealous:** The emotion arises. Thoughts swirl. Body sensations intensify.

**Acting on jealousy:** Checking their phone. Interrogating. Accusing. Controlling.

The feeling is human. The acting out is where damage happens. The goal is to widen the gap between feeling and action.

---

## What Happens in the Body

Jealousy is physical:

- Racing heart
- Tightness in chest or stomach
- Heat, flushing
- Muscle tension
- Nausea
- Shallow breathing

These are signs of your nervous system activating—fight, flight, or freeze. In this state, clear thinking is compromised. You're operating from the alarm center of the brain.

Recognizing the physical signs gives you an early warning.

---

## The Pause

The most important thing you can do when jealousy hits: **pause.**

Don't immediately:
- Ask the question
- Check the phone
- Send the text
- Make the accusation

Instead:
- Notice you're triggered
- Take a breath (or several)
- Feel what's happening in your body
- Create space before responding

The pause breaks the automatic reactive chain.

## Practices for the Moment

**1. Name it**
"I'm feeling jealous right now." Naming it creates a bit of distance from it.

**2. Feel the body**
Where is the sensation? What does it feel like? Stay with the physical experience rather than the mental story.

**3. Breathe**
Slow, deep breaths. This directly calms the nervous system.

**4. Ground yourself**
Feel your feet on the floor. Look around the room. Come into present-moment awareness.

**5. Wait**
Set a timer if needed. Don't act for 10 minutes. Many urges pass.

**6. Question the story**
Is the worst-case scenario you're imagining actually true? What evidence do you have?

### Part 1: Your Reactive Patterns

<Journal
  id="reactive-patterns"
  prompt="What do you typically do when jealousy hits?

• What actions do you take automatically?
• What do you say?
• What do you check or investigate?
• How long does it take for you to act on the feeling?

Know your pattern so you can interrupt it."
  placeholder="Actions I take automatically:

What I check or investigate:

### Part 2: The Cost of Reacting

<Journal
  id="cost-of-reacting"
  prompt="What has acting on jealousy cost you?

• How has it affected your relationships?
• How has it made you feel about yourself?
• What has it done to trust?
• What would be different if you responded rather than reacted?

Understanding the cost motivates change."
  placeholder="How it's affected my relationships:

How it's made me feel about myself:

What it's done to trust:

What would be different if I responded rather than reacted:"

### Part 3: Your Plan

<Journal
  id="jealousy-response-plan"
  prompt="Create a plan for the next time jealousy hits:

• What will be your first step? (Pause, breathe, name it...)
• What will you not do? (Check phone, accuse, interrogate...)
• How will you ground yourself?
• What will you remind yourself of?

Having a plan helps you use it."

What I will NOT do:

What I will remind myself of:"

<Callout type="insight">
You can feel jealousy without acting on it. The feeling will pass. The actions can cause lasting damage.

## Responding vs. Reacting

**Reacting:** Automatic, from the triggered state. Saying and doing things you'll regret.

**Responding:** Intentional, from a calmer place. Choosing how to address the situation.

You can't always control the reaction—the initial surge of feeling. But you can pause before it becomes action.

**After the pause:**
If something genuinely needs to be discussed, you can bring it up. But from a calmer place, as a conversation rather than an accusation.

"I noticed I felt jealous when X happened. Can we talk about it?"

Different from: "Who was that? Why were you talking to them? What's going on?"

---

## What Not to Do

**Don't check their phone/email/social.**
This erodes trust and feeds the obsession.

**Don't interrogate.**
Cross-examination creates defensiveness, not connection.

**Don't accuse.**
Accusations put them on trial for things they may not have done.

**Don't make ultimatums.**
Threats escalate rather than resolve.

**Don't try to control their behavior.**
You can't eliminate all possible threats through control.

These behaviors feel like solutions but create more problems.

---

## When You Slip

You will slip. You'll react before you respond. It happens.

**When it does:**
- Acknowledge it. "I'm sorry, I was reactive."
- Take responsibility. Don't blame them for your reaction.
- Learn from it. What triggered you? What could you do differently?
- Repair the damage. If you said hurtful things, address them.

Slipping doesn't mean failure. It means you're human. What matters is what you do next.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Pause before acting.** The gap between feeling and action is where freedom lives.

- **Feel the body.** Get out of the spinning thoughts and into physical sensation.

- **Responding is different from reacting.** One is automatic; the other is chosen.

- **Checking and controlling makes it worse.** These behaviors feed the jealousy, not resolve it.

## What's Next

In Module 4, we'll explore a deeper kind of trust—trust in yourself and your ability to handle whatever happens.

*You can't always control what you feel. You can learn to control what you do with it.*
