## The Decision to Trust

Trust in another person is a choice—a calculated risk you make based on assessment, not blind faith.

You can't control whether someone is trustworthy. But you can develop discernment about who to trust, and you can choose how much access to give.

---

## What Trust Actually Is

Trust isn't:
- Believing someone is perfect
- Never having doubts
- Being naive
- Giving unlimited access from the start

Trust is:
- A reasonable assessment that someone will act in good faith
- Based on patterns, not just words
- Given incrementally as it's earned
- Repairable when broken (sometimes)
- An ongoing choice, not a one-time decision

## How Trust Is Built

Trust is earned through:

**Consistency.**
They do what they say. Their words match their actions. You can predict them.

**Reliability.**
They show up. They follow through. They're there when needed.

**Honesty.**
They tell the truth, even when it's uncomfortable.

**Respect.**
They treat you well. They honor your boundaries.

**Vulnerability.**
They open up too. Trust builds when both people take risks.

**Time.**
Trust develops over time through repeated positive experiences.

**Repair.**
When they mess up, they take responsibility and make amends.

---

## Earned Trust vs. Given Trust

**Given trust** is extended upfront, hoping it will be honored.

**Earned trust** is extended based on demonstrated trustworthiness.

Neither is purely right:
- Only given trust risks being naive
- Only earned trust can prevent connection

The balance: Start with reasonable openness, then calibrate based on what you observe.

### Part 2: Trust in Your Current Relationship

<Journal
  id="current-relationship-trust"
  prompt="Assess trust in your current or recent relationship:

• What has your partner done to earn trust?
• What has made trust harder?
• Is your distrust based on their behavior or your patterns?
• What would help you trust more?

Be honest about both their behavior and your patterns."
  placeholder="What they've done to earn trust:

What has made trust harder:

Whether distrust is about their behavior or my patterns:

What would help me trust more:"

/>

### Part 3: Your Trust Criteria

<Journal
  id="trust-criteria"
  prompt="What does someone need to do to earn your trust?

• What behaviors are essential?
• What can you accept as human imperfection?
• What's a dealbreaker that would prevent or break trust?
• How would you know when trust is established?

Clarify what trust means to you."
  placeholder="Essential behaviors for trust:

What I can accept as human imperfection:

<Callout type="insight">
Trust is not about eliminating risk. It's about making a reasonable assessment and choosing to be vulnerable anyway.

## When Trust Is Challenged

Sometimes trust is genuinely challenged:

**They do something questionable.**
Not clearly betrayal, but concerning. This requires conversation, not immediate judgment.

**Your wounds get triggered.**
It looks like a trust violation, but it might be your pattern. Discernment is required.

**There's actual betrayal.**
Clear violation of your trust. This is different from a trigger.

**How to tell the difference:**
- What would a neutral observer say?
- Is there a pattern, or was this one instance?
- What does their behavior overall suggest?
- Are you seeing through a wound lens or clearly?

---

## Rebuilding Broken Trust

Sometimes trust is broken and needs to be rebuilt.

**What rebuilding requires:**

From them:
- Full acknowledgment of what happened
- Genuine remorse (not just getting caught)
- Understanding why it happened
- Commitment to change
- Patience with your healing process
- Consistent trustworthy behavior over time

From you:
- Willingness to eventually forgive
- Ability to risk trust again
- Not using the betrayal as a permanent weapon
- Observing their behavior for real change

**Can trust always be rebuilt?**
Not always. Some betrayals are too severe. Some people don't do the work. You get to decide.

## Trusting Without Certainty

Here's the uncomfortable truth: You can never be 100% certain someone is trustworthy.

**You can:**
- Make your best assessment
- Look at patterns over time
- Listen to your gut
- Create reasonable expectations
- Accept that trust involves risk

**You cannot:**
- Guarantee they'll never hurt you
- Control their behavior
- Eliminate all uncertainty
- Make trust risk-free

At some point, you choose to trust despite uncertainty. That's vulnerability. That's also love.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Trust is earned, not given blindly.** Based on patterns, not just words.

- **Discernment is essential.** Know what trustworthiness looks like.

- **Your wounds affect your trust.** Sometimes distrust is about you, not them.

- **Trust involves risk.** You can never eliminate uncertainty completely.

## What's Next

In Module 6, we'll explore what it looks like to relate from security—when trust replaces fear as the foundation.

*Trusting someone is a risk. But refusing to trust is also a risk—the risk of never truly connecting.*
