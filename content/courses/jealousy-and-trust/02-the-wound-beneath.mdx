## The Real Source

Jealousy's intensity usually comes from somewhere deeper than the current situation. It comes from wounds—often old ones.

The partner who just smiled at someone triggered a fear of abandonment you've carried since childhood. The text from a coworker activated a not-enoughness belief formed decades ago.

Understanding these wounds is essential to working with jealousy.

## Attachment Wounds

How you attached to caregivers in childhood shapes how you attach in adult relationships.

**Secure attachment:**
You learned that people are reliable, available, and responsive. You can trust. Jealousy is mild and manageable.

**Anxious attachment:**
You learned that connection is uncertain. People might leave. You become hypervigilant to threats, need constant reassurance, fear abandonment intensely. Jealousy is common and intense.

**Avoidant attachment:**
You learned to not need people, to not show vulnerability. You might seem to not experience jealousy—but it can emerge in surprising ways.

**Disorganized attachment:**
You learned that connection is both needed and dangerous. Relationships trigger both longing and fear.

Your attachment style affects how prone you are to jealousy and how you express it.

## The Abandonment Wound

For many people, jealousy is abandonment fear in action.

**Where abandonment fears come from:**
- A parent who left, literally or emotionally
- Being rejected or bullied as a child
- Past relationships that ended painfully
- Experiencing betrayal
- Loss that felt like abandonment

**How abandonment fear manifests in jealousy:**
- Hypervigilance to any sign they might leave
- Reading innocent interactions as threats
- Needing constant reassurance
- Trying to control to prevent abandonment
- Pushing away before you can be abandoned

The fear says: "Everyone leaves. I'll be abandoned. I'm not worth staying for."

---

## The Not-Enoughness Wound

Another root of jealousy: the belief that you're not enough.

**Where not-enoughness comes from:**
- Critical or withholding parents
- Comparison to siblings or peers
- Early experiences of rejection
- Cultural messages about worth
- Past relationships where you weren't "enough"

**How not-enoughness manifests in jealousy:**
- Comparison with anyone who might be a "threat"
- Assuming your partner secretly wants someone better
- Interpreting their interest in others as proof you're inadequate
- Trying to be "more" to prevent them from looking elsewhere
- Deep insecurity about your worth

The belief says: "I'm not enough. Someone else is better. They'll realize this and leave."

<Exercise title="Exploring Your Wounds">

### Part 1: Your Attachment Style

<Journal
  id="attachment-style"
  prompt="Explore your attachment patterns:

• How did you learn to attach in childhood? Were caregivers reliable? Available?
• Do you tend toward anxious (fear abandonment, need reassurance) or avoidant (fear closeness, pull away)?
• How does your attachment style show up in jealousy?
• What would you have needed as a child that you didn't get?

Understanding attachment is key to understanding jealousy."
  placeholder="How I learned to attach in childhood:

Whether I'm more anxious or avoidant:

How my attachment shows up in jealousy:

What I needed but didn't get:"

### Part 2: Your Abandonment Fears

<Journal
  id="abandonment-fears"
  prompt="Explore your relationship with abandonment:

• Have you been abandoned—literally or emotionally—in the past?
• What was the worst abandonment you experienced?
• What does your fear of abandonment tell you about what will happen?
• How does this fear show up in your current relationship?

Name the wound."
  placeholder="Past abandonment experiences:

### Part 3: Your Not-Enoughness

<Journal
  id="not-enoughness"
  prompt="Explore your beliefs about your worth:

• In what ways do you feel 'not enough' in relationships?
• Where did this belief come from?
• Who or what do you compare yourself to?
• What would you need to believe about yourself to feel secure?

The not-enoughness wound runs deep. Bring it into the light."
  placeholder="Ways I feel 'not enough':

<Callout type="insight">
Your jealousy isn't crazy. It's pointing to real wounds that need healing—wounds that existed before your current partner ever triggered them.

## Wounds Don't Define You

These wounds are real. They affect you. But they're not the truth about you.

**The abandonment wound** says you'll be left, but people can stay.

**The not-enoughness wound** says you're inadequate, but you have inherent worth.

**The attachment wound** says connection isn't safe, but secure relating is possible.

Wounds are patterns from the past. They can be healed, updated, transformed.

---

## Healing the Wounds

Healing happens through:

**Awareness.**
Seeing the wound clearly. Naming it. Understanding where it came from.

**Feeling.**
Allowing yourself to feel the pain beneath the jealousy. The original hurt that was never fully processed.

**Reparenting.**
Giving yourself what you didn't get. Reliability, reassurance, unconditional positive regard.

**New experiences.**
Creating new experiences that update the old patterns. Secure relating that challenges old beliefs.

**Self-compassion.**
Treating yourself with kindness when the wounds get triggered.

This is deep work. It takes time. But it's possible.

---

## The Role of the Partner

Your partner can help, but they can't heal you.

**What a partner can do:**
- Be consistent and reliable
- Reassure when you need it (within reason)
- Be patient with your process
- Not deliberately trigger your wounds
- Create safety

**What a partner can't do:**
- Fix your wounds for you
- Provide endless reassurance that never sticks
- Never trigger you
- Be responsible for your emotional regulation

The healing is yours to do. A good partner can support it, but not substitute for it.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Jealousy often comes from attachment wounds.** How you learned to attach affects how you experience jealousy.

- **Abandonment fear** is common beneath jealousy. The belief that you'll be left.

- **Not-enoughness** is another root. The belief that someone better will replace you.

- **Wounds can heal.** Through awareness, feeling, reparenting, and new experiences.

## What's Next

In Module 3, we'll explore what to do when jealousy hits in the moment—how to handle it without acting out.

*The wound was created in the past, but it lives in the present. Understanding it is the first step to freeing yourself from it.*
