## Trauma Lives in the Body

Trauma isn't just in your mind—it's in your body. Muscles hold tension, posture reflects survival patterns, and sensations carry memories. Healing trauma requires working with the body, not just the mind. This module explores somatic approaches to trauma healing.

## Why the Body Matters

### Beyond Talk Therapy

Traditional therapy:
- Works with thoughts and narratives
- Engages the rational brain
- Can help but often incomplete
- May not reach body-held trauma

### The Body Keeps the Score

Trauma is stored:
- In muscle tension patterns
- In posture and movement
- In physical symptoms
- In nervous system activation
- In implicit (non-verbal) memory

### Body-Based Healing

Somatic approaches:
- Access what words can't reach
- Work with nervous system directly
- Complete interrupted responses
- Release stored tension
- Restore body connection

## Interoception: Reading the Body

### What Is Interoception?

Interoception is:
- Awareness of internal body states
- Reading signals from inside
- Sensing hunger, thirst, emotions, etc.
- The foundation of embodiment

### Trauma Disrupts Interoception

Trauma often causes:
- Disconnection from body signals
- Misreading body sensations
- Either hypersensitivity or numbness
- Difficulty knowing what you need

### Rebuilding Interoception

Rebuild through:
- Regular body check-ins
- Noticing without judgment
- Gentle, gradual attention
- Tolerance of sensation

<Exercise title="Body Scan Practice">

## Trauma and the Nervous System

### The Survival Responses

When threatened:
- **Fight:** Muscles tense for action, energy rises
- **Flight:** Energy for escape, urge to run
- **Freeze:** Immobilization, shutdown
- **Fawn:** Orienting to appease

### Incomplete Responses

Trauma often involves:
- Survival response that couldn't complete
- Energy that didn't discharge
- Action that didn't happen
- Body stuck in survival mode

### Completing the Response

Healing can involve:
- Completing interrupted movements
- Discharging trapped energy
- Allowing body to do what it couldn't
- Finishing the survival sequence

## Somatic Resources

### What Are Somatic Resources?

Somatic resources are:
- Body-based experiences of safety
- Felt sense of regulation
- Physical sensations of calm
- Embodied support

### Examples

Resources might include:
- Feeling feet grounded
- Sense of strength in arms
- Breath moving freely
- Warmth in chest
- Overall sense of solidity

### Finding Your Resources

Discover resources through:
- Noticing what feels good or neutral
- Finding body areas that feel okay
- Connecting to physical strength
- Experiencing support (chair, ground)

---

<Exercise title="Finding Somatic Resources">

Discover your somatic resources.

<Journal
  id="tbr-resources"
  prompt="Discover your somatic resources:

SCAN FOR NEUTRAL/GOOD:

## Pendulation and Titration

### Pendulation

Pendulation is:
- Moving between activation and resource
- Not staying in distress too long
- Returning to safety regularly
- Building capacity gradually

### Titration

Titration is:
- Small doses of difficult material
- Not flooding the system
- Manageable chunks
- Gradual processing

### Why These Matter

These principles:
- Prevent re-traumatization
- Keep you in window of tolerance
- Allow processing without overwhelm
- Build nervous system resilience

---

<Exercise title="Pendulation Practice">

Practice pendulation.

<Journal
  id="tbr-pendulate"
  prompt="Practice pendulation:

1. Notice something slightly uncomfortable in your body
2. Spend a moment noticing it (without going deep)
3. Now shift attention to a resource (place that feels okay)
4. Stay with the resource until you feel settled
5. Notice the shift between the two

UNCOMFORTABLE SENSATION:
What did you notice?

RESOURCE:
What did you notice?

THE SHIFT:
What was it like to move between them?

REFLECTION:
How might this practice help in healing?"

## Movement and Trauma

### Trauma Affects Movement

Trauma can cause:
- Restricted movement
- Held postures
- Disconnection from body
- Fear of physical sensation

### Healing Movement

Movement can help through:
- Completing survival responses
- Releasing stored tension
- Reconnecting with body
- Building sense of agency

### Types of Healing Movement

Options include:
- Gentle yoga (trauma-sensitive)
- Walking
- Dance
- Shaking (intentional tremoring)
- Any movement that feels safe

---

<Exercise title="Gentle Movement Practice">

Explore gentle movement.

<Journal
  id="tbr-movement"
  prompt="Explore gentle movement:

Try some gentle movements and notice what happens:
- Slowly roll your shoulders
- Gently turn your head side to side
- Softly shake your hands
- Push against a wall and then release
- Any other movement that feels good

## Breath as Bridge

### Breath and Nervous System

Breath:
- Is both automatic and controllable
- Bridges body and mind
- Directly affects nervous system
- Is always available

### Trauma and Breath

Trauma often disrupts:
- Breathing patterns
- Depth of breath
- Connection to breath
- Breath as resource

### Breath Practices

Helpful practices:
- Simply noticing breath (without changing)
- Gentle lengthening of exhale
- Slow, natural breathing
- Not forcing or controlling

---

<Exercise title="Breath Awareness">

Practice breath awareness.

<Journal
  id="tbr-breath"
  prompt="Practice breath awareness:

Spend a few minutes simply noticing your breath.
Don't try to change it—just observe.

## Orienting and Present-Moment Awareness

### What Is Orienting?

Orienting is:
- Looking around to assess environment
- Natural safety-seeking behavior
- Often disrupted by trauma
- Can be deliberately practiced

### Why It Helps

Orienting:
- Brings you into present moment
- Shows your nervous system you're safe now
- Counters time-traveling to trauma
- Activates natural calming

### Orienting Practice

Try:
- Slowly looking around the room
- Naming what you see
- Noticing colors, shapes, objects
- Letting eyes rest on what feels interesting
- Taking time, not rushing

---

<Exercise title="Orienting Practice">

Practice orienting.

<Journal
  id="tbr-orient"
  prompt="Practice orienting:

Slowly look around your environment.
Let your gaze move naturally.
Notice what you see.

## Key Concepts

- **Body holds trauma:** Trauma is stored in muscles, posture, nervous system
- **Interoception:** Reading internal body signals—often disrupted by trauma
- **Somatic resources:** Body-based experiences of safety and regulation
- **Pendulation:** Moving between activation and resource
- **Titration:** Processing in small, manageable doses
- **Movement:** Can complete survival responses and release tension
- **Breath:** Bridge between body and mind, direct access to nervous system
- **Orienting:** Looking around to establish present-moment safety
- **Regular practice:** Building body awareness and capacity over time

---

<Callout type="important">
The body remembers what the mind may have forgotten. Trauma healing isn't complete without including the body. Through practices like body scanning, resourcing, movement, breath awareness, and orienting, you can access and heal what words alone can't reach. Be gentle with yourself—the body needs patience and care.
</Callout>

*The body is not just where trauma is stored—it's where it can be healed.*
