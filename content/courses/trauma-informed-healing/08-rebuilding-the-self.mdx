## Who Am I After Trauma?

Trauma doesn't just affect what happened to you—it affects who you believe yourself to be. Identity gets fragmented, sense of self gets distorted, and you may not know who you are apart from your trauma. This module focuses on rebuilding a coherent, positive sense of self.

---

## Trauma's Impact on Identity

### Identity Fragmentation

Trauma can fragment identity:
- Parts of self split off
- Disconnection from self
- Not knowing who you are
- Feeling like multiple selves
- Loss of continuity

### Negative Self-Concepts

Trauma creates beliefs like:
- I am damaged
- I am unlovable
- I am weak
- I am worthless
- I am defined by what happened

### Loss of Self

Trauma can cause:
- Disconnection from authentic self
- Not knowing your own needs
- Loss of voice and agency
- Identity organized around trauma
- Not knowing who you'd be without it

## Separating Self from Trauma

### You Are Not Your Trauma

Important distinction:
- Trauma happened to you
- It is not who you are
- It's part of your story, not your identity
- You are more than what happened

### The Survivor vs. The Person

You are:
- A person who survived something
- Not just a survivor
- Someone with many qualities
- Not defined by one set of experiences

### Identity Beyond Trauma

Reclaiming identity means:
- Expanding beyond trauma identity
- Connecting to other aspects of self
- Building identity on more than suffering
- Knowing you existed before and after

---

<Exercise title="Identity Beyond Trauma">

Explore identity beyond your trauma.

<Journal
  id="rts-beyond"
  prompt="Explore identity beyond trauma:

• Who were you before trauma?
• What qualities exist apart from your trauma?
• What interests, values, or traits define you?
• What would you be if trauma weren't central to identity?

## Healing Shame

### Trauma and Shame

Trauma often creates shame:
- Shame about what happened
- Shame about how you responded
- Shame about symptoms
- Shame about being "damaged"
- Core shame about who you are

### Why Shame Develops

Shame develops because:
- Children internalize blame
- Helplessness feels shameful
- Responses may seem "wrong" in hindsight
- Society shames victims
- Shame was used as weapon

### Shame vs. Reality

The truth is:
- It wasn't your fault
- Your responses were survival
- You did what you could
- Shame doesn't belong to you
- You are not defective

---

<Exercise title="Working with Shame">

Explore and address your shame.

<Journal
  id="rts-shame"
  prompt="Explore your shame:

• What shame do you carry from trauma?
• What do you blame yourself for?
• Where did these shame messages come from?
• What would you tell someone else with your experience?
• What's the truth that counters the shame?"

## Reclaiming Agency

### Loss of Agency

Trauma involves loss of control:
- Helplessness during trauma
- Loss of choice
- Things done to you, not by you
- Powerlessness

### Rebuilding Agency

Agency is rebuilt through:
- Making choices now
- Having voice and saying no
- Taking action on your behalf
- Experiencing your own power
- Knowing you can affect outcomes

### Small Choices Matter

Agency returns through:
- Small daily choices
- Speaking up about preferences
- Setting boundaries
- Making decisions for yourself
- Taking action on your own behalf

---

<Exercise title="Reclaiming Your Agency">

<Journal

  prompt="Explore reclaiming agency:

## Self-Compassion

### Why Self-Compassion Matters

Self-compassion:
- Counters trauma's self-blame
- Offers kindness instead of criticism
- Recognizes shared humanity
- Provides warmth and care
- Is essential for healing

### Self-Compassion Practice

Self-compassion includes:
- Treating yourself as you'd treat a friend
- Acknowledging suffering without judgment
- Recognizing you're not alone
- Offering kindness to yourself

### The Inner Critic

Trauma often creates harsh inner critic:
- Constant self-judgment
- Attack for perceived failures
- Never good enough
- The abuser's voice internalized

Self-compassion counters this voice.

---

<Exercise title="Self-Compassion Practice">

Practice self-compassion.

<Journal
  id="rts-compass"
  prompt="Practice self-compassion:

Think about your trauma and your healing:

WHAT I'D SAY TO A FRIEND:

WHAT I TELL MYSELF:
What do you actually tell yourself?

COMPASSIONATE REFRAME:
How could you speak to yourself more kindly?

WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR:

## Strengths and Resources

### You Survived

Remember:
- You survived your trauma
- You found ways to cope
- You have strengths that got you through
- Those strengths are still with you

### Your Strengths

Identify your strengths:
- What helped you survive?
- What capacities do you have?
- What are you good at?
- What positive qualities do you have?

### Building on Strengths

Healing builds on strengths:
- Not just addressing wounds
- Also cultivating what's strong
- Using your capacities
- Growing from your foundation

---

## Creating New Self-Concept

### Who You're Becoming

- Becoming who you want to be

### Writing Your New Story

Consider:
- Who do you want to be?
- What qualities do you want to embody?
- What role does trauma play in your story?
- What's your narrative going forward?

### Identity as Choice

To some extent:
- You can choose who to be
- Past doesn't determine future self
- Identity can be consciously cultivated
- You're the author of your story

<Callout type="important">
You are not your trauma. Trauma happened to you; it shaped you; but it is not who you are. Your identity is larger than what happened. Through healing shame, reclaiming agency, practicing self-compassion, recognizing strengths, and consciously creating your self-concept, you can rebuild a sense of self that includes but transcends your trauma.
</Callout>

*You are the author of your story. Trauma is a chapter, not the whole book.*
