## Trauma and Connection

Trauma doesn't happen in isolation—and it rarely leaves relationships untouched. Whether trauma occurred within relationships or affects how you relate, healing involves rebuilding the capacity for safe connection. This module explores healing relationships after trauma.

## How Trauma Affects Relationships

### Trust Damage

Trauma often damages trust:
- In others (they may hurt or abandon)
- In yourself (I couldn't protect myself)
- In the world (nowhere is safe)
- In relationships (intimacy equals danger)

### Attachment Disruption

Trauma affects attachment:
- Difficulty with closeness
- Fear of intimacy
- Anxious clinging
- Avoidant distance
- Push-pull patterns

### Relational Patterns

Trauma creates patterns:
- Re-enactment of dynamics
- Attraction to familiar (even if harmful)
- Difficulty with boundaries
- Over-giving or withdrawal
- Expecting betrayal

## Attachment After Trauma

### Attachment Styles

Trauma often creates or reinforces:
- **Anxious attachment:** Fear of abandonment, clinging, need for reassurance
- **Avoidant attachment:** Distance, independence, discomfort with closeness
- **Disorganized attachment:** Confusion, both wanting and fearing connection

### Understanding Your Pattern

Your pattern likely:
- Made sense as adaptation
- Protected you in some way
- May no longer serve you
- Can be updated with awareness and practice

### Earned Secure Attachment

Secure attachment can be:
- Developed in adulthood
- Built through healing relationships
- Cultivated with intention
- Not dependent on perfect childhood

## Rebuilding Trust

### Trust After Betrayal

Rebuilding trust requires:
- Time and consistency
- Small steps, not leaps
- Evidence over time
- Discernment about who to trust

### Discernment vs. Mistrust

The goal isn't:
- Trusting everyone
- Being naive
- Having no boundaries

The goal is:
- Accurate assessment
- Trusting trustworthy people
- Appropriate vulnerability
- Healthy discernment

### Trusting Yourself

Foundation of trust is self-trust:
- I can assess situations
- I can handle what happens
- I can set boundaries
- I can leave if needed
- I can take care of myself

## Boundaries After Trauma

### Why Boundaries Matter

Boundaries:

- Difficulty saying no
- Not knowing your own limits

### Healthy Boundaries

Healthy boundaries:
- Are flexible, not rigid
- Protect without isolating
- Can be communicated
- Are based on self-knowledge
- Can be adjusted
