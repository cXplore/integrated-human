## Your Unique Pattern

No two trauma experiences are identical. Your history, your responses, your symptoms, and your strengths create a unique profile. This module helps you map your specific patterns so healing work can be tailored to your needs.

---

## Why Mapping Matters

### Personalized Healing

Understanding your profile:
- Helps target healing efforts
- Reveals your specific patterns
- Shows where to focus
- Identifies your resources
- Creates a healing roadmap

### Not Re-traumatizing

This mapping should be:
- Done with care
- At your own pace
- Without forcing details
- From a place of safety
- With self-compassion

### You Control the Pace

Go only as far as feels manageable:
- You can skip questions
- You can come back later
- You can stay general
- You don't have to relive anything
- Safety first, always

## Your Trauma History

### Types You've Experienced

Without needing to detail events, identify types:
- Single-incident experiences
- Ongoing or repeated experiences
- Early childhood experiences
- Attachment-related experiences
- Witnessed or secondary trauma

### Timeline Awareness

General awareness of when:
- Earliest experiences
- Most impactful periods
- Recent experiences
- Current stressors

### What You Know vs. Don't Know

Note:
- What you remember clearly
- What's fuzzy or fragmented
- Periods you can't remember
- Things you've been told happened

## Your Triggers

### What Are Triggers?

Triggers are:
- Reminders that activate trauma responses
- Not the original event, but something associated
- Signals of danger (even if there's none now)
- Automatic, not chosen

### Types of Triggers

Triggers can be:
- **Sensory:** Sounds, smells, sights, textures, tastes
- **Situational:** Places, events, times of year
- **Relational:** People, dynamics, behaviors
- **Internal:** Thoughts, emotions, body sensations
- **Unexpected:** Things you don't expect to be triggering

### Your Specific Triggers

Identifying triggers helps:
- Prepare for them
- Respond skillfully
- Reduce surprise activations
- Work with them consciously

## Your Survival Responses

### How You Survived

Everyone develops strategies:
- Ways of coping
- Patterns of protection
- Adaptations to threat
- Methods of managing

### Common Strategies

These might include:
- Hypervigilance (always watching)
- People-pleasing (fawning)
- Perfectionism (controlling what you can)
- Dissociation (disconnecting)
- Avoidance (staying away from reminders)
- Numbing (substances, behaviors)
- Over-functioning (staying busy)

### Adaptive Origins

These strategies:
- Made sense in context
- Helped you survive
- May no longer serve you
- Can be updated with new resources

<Journal
  id="ytp-survival"

## Your Window of Tolerance

### Assessing Your Window

Evaluate:
- How wide is your window currently?
- How easily do you get dysregulated?
- What takes you outside the window?
- How long do you stay dysregulated?
- What brings you back?

### Hyperarousal Pattern

When activated:
- What do you experience?
- How often does this happen?
- What triggers it?
- What helps calm it?

### Hypoarousal Pattern

When shutdown:
- What do you experience?
- How often does this happen?
- What triggers it?
- What helps re-engage?

<Exercise title="Your Regulation Patterns">

Assess your regulation patterns.

<Journal
  id="ytp-regulation"

<Callout type="important">
Your trauma profile is unique to you. Understanding your specific patterns—symptoms, triggers, survival strategies, window of tolerance, and resources—creates a map for your healing journey. This isn't about dwelling on trauma but about understanding what needs attention and what resources you have. With this map, healing can be targeted and effective.
