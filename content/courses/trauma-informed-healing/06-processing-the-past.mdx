## Working with What Happened

With safety established and skills developed, you can begin to work with the traumatic material itself. This isn't about reliving trauma—it's about processing it so it no longer has the same hold on you. This module explores how to safely work with the past.

---

## What Processing Means

### Not Reliving

Processing is not:
- Re-experiencing the trauma
- Flooding yourself with memories
- Telling the story repeatedly
- Forcing recall of details
- Retraumatizing yourself

### Processing Is

Processing means:
- Digesting what happened
- Making sense of experience
- Completing interrupted responses
- Updating the nervous system
- Integrating memory into life story

### The Goal

The goal of processing:
- Memories become past, not present
- Emotional charge decreases
- Body releases held responses
- Narrative becomes coherent
- You're no longer stuck

• Do you have stable safety and resources?
• Can you regulate when activated?
• Do you have support available?
• What feels ready to be processed?

## Processing Principles

### Safety First, Always

Maintain safety:
- Stay within window of tolerance
- Use grounding and resources
- Stop if overwhelmed
- Return to stabilization as needed
- Processing can wait

### Titration

Small doses:
- Process in manageable pieces
- Not the whole trauma at once
- Brief touches, then return to resource
- Build capacity gradually

### Pendulation

Move between:
- Activation and resource
- Past and present
- Difficult and safe
- Never staying too long in difficulty

### You're in Control

Remember:
- You decide the pace
- You can stop anytime
- You don't have to remember everything
- Partial processing is still progress

---

## Approaches to Processing

### Narrative Approaches

Working with the story:
- Telling what happened
- Writing about it
- Creating coherent narrative
- Making sense of experience

### Somatic Approaches

Working with the body:
- Releasing held tension
- Completing survival movements
- Discharging stored energy
- Letting body process

### Emotional Approaches

Working with feelings:
- Allowing suppressed emotions
- Grieving what was lost
- Expressing what couldn't be expressed
- Feeling what couldn't be felt

### Cognitive Approaches

Working with thoughts:
- Challenging distorted beliefs
- Updating interpretations
- Separating past from present
- Creating new meaning

---

<Exercise title="Your Processing Approach">

Consider what approaches might help you.

<Journal
  id="ptp-approach"
  prompt="Consider processing approaches:

NARRATIVE:
Would working with your story help? How?

SOMATIC:
Would body-based processing help? How?

EMOTIONAL:
Would emotional processing help? How?

COGNITIVE:
Would working with beliefs help? How?

YOUR COMBINATION:
What combination might work for you?"

## Safe Memory Work

### Accessing Memories Safely

When working with memories:
- Start with less intense material
- Stay grounded in present
- Maintain observer perspective
- Use distance techniques
- Return to safety regularly

### Distance Techniques

Create distance:
- Watch as if on a movie screen
- Shrink the image
- Make it black and white
- Add a frame around it
- See it from outside

### Window of Tolerance Check

Continuously check:
- Am I still in my window?
- Am I getting overwhelmed?
- Do I need to stop?
- What do I need right now?

---

<Exercise title="Safe Memory Practice">

Practice accessing a mild memory safely.

<Journal
  id="ptp-memory"
  prompt="Practice with a mild uncomfortable memory (NOT trauma):

Choose something mildly uncomfortable, not traumatic.

THE MEMORY:
What memory will you work with? (just identify, don't dive in)

GROUNDING FIRST:
Ground yourself. What do you notice?

BRIEF TOUCH:
Briefly touch the memory (5-10 seconds). What do you notice?

RETURN TO RESOURCE:
Return to a resource. What do you notice?

REFLECTION:
What was this practice like? What helped?"

## Working with Emotions

### Emotions That Couldn't Be Felt

Trauma often involves:
- Emotions too overwhelming to feel
- Suppressed feelings
- Frozen emotional responses
- Delayed emotional reactions

### Allowing Emotions Now

Processing includes:
- Letting emotions move through
- Crying that couldn't happen
- Anger that couldn't be expressed
- Fear that couldn't be felt
- Grief that was postponed

### Emotional Containment

Balance between:
- Allowing emotions
- Not flooding
- Feeling without drowning
- Titrating emotional intensity
- Completing, not repeating

---

<Exercise title="Emotional Processing Reflection">

Reflect on emotions connected to your experiences.

<Journal
  id="ptp-emotion"
  prompt="Reflect on emotions (gently):

• What emotions are connected to your traumatic experiences?
• Which emotions were you unable to feel at the time?
• Which emotions are still held or unprocessed?
• What would it mean to allow these emotions now?
• What support would you need for emotional processing?"
  placeholder="Connected emotions:

  rows={18}

</Exercise>

## Working with the Body

### Body-Based Processing

The body processes through:
- Movement and discharge
- Trembling and shaking
- Completing survival actions
- Releasing held tension
- Physical expression

### Allowing Body Completion

Let the body:
- Do what it couldn't do
- Complete interrupted movements
- Discharge trapped energy
- Find its own way to release

### Somatic Processing Practices

Practices might include:
- Pushing against resistance
- Slow defensive movements
- Shaking and tremoring
- Releasing held postures
- Movement with awareness

---

## Working with Narrative

### Creating Coherent Story

A coherent narrative:
- Has beginning, middle, end
- Makes sense
- Isn't fragmented
- Places trauma in past
- Integrates with life story

### Writing Your Story

Consider:
- Writing about what happened
- Journaling through the experience
- Creating a timeline
- Organizing fragments

### The Story Isn't the Goal

Remember:
- Complete recall isn't necessary
- Some things can't be remembered
- The story is a tool, not the point
- Processing matters more than details

---

<Exercise title="Narrative Reflection">

Reflect on your trauma narrative.

<Journal
  id="ptp-narrative"
  prompt="Reflect on your narrative (without forcing details):

• How coherent is your understanding of what happened?
• What parts feel clear? What's fragmented?
• What would help you create a more coherent narrative?
• What would it mean to place this story firmly in the past?
• How might writing help (if at all)?"

## Updating Beliefs

### Trauma-Based Beliefs

Trauma often creates beliefs like:
- "I'm not safe"
- "I'm damaged"
- "It was my fault"
- "I can't trust anyone"
- "The world is dangerous"

### Updating to Present

Processing involves:
- Recognizing these as trauma beliefs
- Testing them against current reality
- Developing updated beliefs
- Integrating new understanding

### Beliefs vs. Knowledge

The goal:
- Not just knowing intellectually
- But feeling it in your body
- The nervous system updating
- Deep integration

---

<Exercise title="Belief Update">

Identify beliefs to update.

<Journal
  id="ptp-beliefs"
  prompt="Identify beliefs to update:

TRAUMA BELIEFS:
What beliefs came from your trauma?

CURRENT REALITY:
What's actually true now?

UPDATED BELIEFS:
What would more accurate beliefs be?

INTEGRATION:
What would help these new beliefs feel true?"

<Callout type="important">
Processing trauma is delicate work. It's not about forcing yourself to remember or relive. It's about gently working with what's ready to be processed, at a pace you can handle, with resources available. If this feels too intense to do alone, seek professional support. There's no shame in needing help—it's often the wisest choice.
</Callout>

*Processing isn't about going back. It's about letting the past finally become the past.*
