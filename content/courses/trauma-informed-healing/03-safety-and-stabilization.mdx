## Safety First

Trauma healing doesn't begin with processing trauma—it begins with safety. Without a foundation of safety and stabilization, trauma work can be re-traumatizing. This module builds the essential foundation that makes healing possible.

---

## Why Safety Comes First

### The Three-Phase Model

Trauma treatment typically follows:
1. **Safety and Stabilization** (this module)
2. **Processing** (later modules)
3. **Integration** (final modules)

### Why This Order

Processing without safety:
- Can overwhelm the system
- May re-traumatize
- Lacks resources to cope
- Doesn't hold

With safety first:
- Processing is contained
- Resources are available
- Overwhelm is manageable
- Healing integrates

### Building Before Processing

This phase:
- Takes time
- May seem slow
- Is absolutely essential
- Creates lasting foundation

## Internal Safety

### Felt Sense of Safety

Internal safety is:
- The felt sense of safety inside
- Ability to calm your system
- Trust in your capacity to cope
- Connection to internal resources

### The Challenge

Trauma disrupts internal safety:
- Nervous system stays alert
- Body doesn't feel safe
- Can't easily calm down
- Trust in self is damaged

### Building Internal Safety

Internal safety is built through:
- Nervous system regulation skills
- Body awareness
- Self-soothing capacity
- Internal resources
- Time and practice

## Grounding Techniques

### What Is Grounding?

Grounding:
- Connects you to the present
- Anchors you in current reality
- Counters dissociation
- Activates parasympathetic system

### Sensory Grounding (5-4-3-2-1)

Use your senses:
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch/feel
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

### Physical Grounding

Body-based grounding:
- Feel feet on floor
- Press hands together
- Feel back against chair
- Notice body's weight
- Squeeze and release muscles

### Cognitive Grounding

Mind-based grounding:
- Name where you are
- State the current date/time
- Describe your surroundings
- Remind yourself of safety
- List neutral facts

---

<Exercise title="Grounding Practice">

## Self-Soothing

### The Capacity to Comfort

Self-soothing is:
- Ability to calm yourself
- Comforting your own distress
- Activating relaxation response
- Being your own safe person

### Why It's Often Hard

Trauma can leave you:
- Without models for self-soothing
- Unable to calm down
- Disconnected from comfort
- Distrustful of feeling good

### Building the Capacity

Develop self-soothing through:
- Sensory comfort (soft textures, calming sounds)
- Physical comfort (warmth, gentle touch)
- Emotional comfort (kind self-talk)
- Engaging activities (reading, music)
- Movement (walking, stretching)

## Containment Skills

### What Is Containment?

Containment is:
- Ability to put difficult material "away"
- Boundary between trauma and daily life
- Skill of not being overwhelmed
- Knowing you can come back to it later

### Why It Matters

Containment allows:
- Living life between processing
- Not being flooded constantly
- Controlling when you engage trauma
- Functioning despite trauma history

### Container Visualization

A common technique:
- Visualize a container (box, vault, lake)
- Place difficult material inside
- Close the container
- Know it's held securely
- Return when ready and resourced

---

<Exercise title="Creating Your Container">

<Journal

  prompt="Create your containment strategy:

VISUALIZE YOUR CONTAINER:

## Creating Safe Spaces

### External Safe Spaces

Physical safe spaces:
- A room or corner that feels safe
- A place in nature
- A friend's home
- Anywhere that feels protected

### Internal Safe Spaces

Imagined safe spaces:
- A place in your imagination
- Real or fictional
- Completely safe
- Where nothing can harm you
- Available anytime

### Building Your Safe Place

Create your internal safe space:
- What does it look like?
- What do you see, hear, feel there?
- Who (if anyone) is there?
- What makes it safe?
- How do you get there?

## Emotional Regulation

### The Goal

Emotional regulation means:
- Tolerating emotions without overwhelm

- Allow without acting
- Breathe slowly
- Use grounding
- Self-soothe
- Engage containment if needed

### Building Tolerance

Increase tolerance through:
- Gradual exposure to emotion
- Staying with discomfort briefly
- Expanding window bit by bit
- Celebrating small successes

## Key Concepts

- **Safety first:** Stabilization must precede processing
- **External safety:** Physical, relational, and environmental safety
- **Internal safety:** Felt sense of safety, ability to calm yourself
- **Grounding:** Connecting to present moment (sensory, physical, cognitive)
- **Self-soothing:** Ability to comfort yourself
- **Containment:** Putting difficult material away when needed
- **Safe spaces:** External and internal places of complete safety
- **Emotional regulation:** Staying within window of tolerance
- **Daily practice:** Consistent routines build lasting stability

---

<Callout type="important">
Safety and stabilization aren't just the first phase—they're the foundation that makes everything else possible. Take time to build this foundation before diving into deeper trauma work. The skills you develop here—grounding, self-soothing, containment, safe spaces, regulation—are the resources you'll use throughout your healing journey and your life.
