## You Have a Default

Everyone has patterns in conflict—ways you habitually respond when disagreement arises. You learned these patterns from family, past relationships, and your own temperament.

Knowing your conflict style helps you catch yourself, adjust when needed, and understand what you bring to the dynamic.

## Common Conflict Styles

### Avoidant

**What it looks like:**
- Sidesteps issues
- Minimizes problems
- Withdraws from confrontation
- Goes silent or changes subject
- Leaves the room
- Waits for things to blow over

**The belief:** Conflict is dangerous and should be avoided.

**The cost:** Problems never get addressed; resentment builds silently.

### Aggressive

**What it looks like:**
- Dominates the conversation
- Attacks to win
- Raises voice, intimidates
- Must be right
- Brings up past grievances
- Doesn't listen

**The belief:** Conflict is about winning or losing.

**The cost:** Partner feels unsafe; connection erodes; wins battles but loses relationship.

### Passive-Aggressive

**What it looks like:**
- Indirect resistance
- Sarcasm and subtle jabs
- Silent treatment
- "Fine, whatever"
- Does what they want while appearing to agree
- Punishes without admitting it

**The belief:** Direct conflict isn't allowed, but I'm still angry.

**The cost:** Confusion, erosion of trust, issues never directly addressed.

### Passive

**What it looks like:**
- Gives in immediately
- Doesn't express own needs
- Agrees to avoid conflict
- Accumulates resentment
- Sacrifices self to keep peace
- Eventually explodes

**The belief:** My needs don't matter; peace at any cost.

**The cost:** Loses self in relationship; resentment builds until eruption.

### Collaborative

**What it looks like:**
- Seeks to understand
- Expresses own needs clearly
- Looks for solutions
- Stays engaged but respectful
- Willing to compromise
- Focuses on resolution

**The belief:** We can work through this together.

**The outcome:** Issues get addressed; connection maintained or deepened.

### Part 1: Self-Assessment

<Journal
  id="yc-style"
  prompt="Examine your conflict patterns:

• Which style(s) do you recognize in yourself?
• What do you typically do when conflict arises?
• How do you feel during conflict (emotionally, physically)?

• Has your style changed over time?"
  placeholder="Styles I recognize:

• How have past relationships influenced your style?
• What are you protecting yourself from?"

  prompt="Consider how your style affects relationships:

• How does your style impact your partner(s)?
• What feedback have you received about how you handle conflict?
• What problems does your style create?
• What does your style cost you?
• What would be different if you handled conflict differently?"

## Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn

### The Stress Response

Conflict triggers stress responses:
- **Fight:** Confronting, attacking, defending aggressively
- **Flight:** Leaving, avoiding, withdrawing
- **Freeze:** Shutting down, going blank, unable to respond
- **Fawn:** People-pleasing, giving in, prioritizing other's feelings

These are automatic, not chosen.

### How It Shows in Conflict

**Fight types:**
- Get louder, more intense
- Won't back down
- May say things they regret
- Need to win

**Flight types:**
- Leave the room/situation
- Change subject
- Refuse to engage
- Need to escape

**Freeze types:**
- Go silent
- Can't think of words
- Feel paralyzed
- Need time to process

**Fawn types:**
- Immediately apologize
- Take all blame
- Sacrifice their position
- Need to restore peace

### Working With Your Response

You can't eliminate your stress response, but you can:
- Recognize when you're triggered
- Take a pause before reacting
- Communicate about your response
- Learn to regulate down from activation

Awareness is the first step.

## Pursuer vs. Distancer

### The Dynamic

A common relationship pattern:

**Pursuer:**
- Seeks closeness during conflict
- Wants to talk it out now
- Follows when partner withdraws
- Escalates to get engagement
- Fears abandonment

**Distancer:**
- Needs space during conflict
- Withdraws to calm down
- Feels overwhelmed by pursuit
- Shuts down when pursued
- Fears engulfment

### The Dance

1. Conflict arises
2. Pursuer wants to talk
3. Distancer needs space
4. Pursuer escalates (feels abandoned)
5. Distancer withdraws more (feels overwhelmed)
6. Both feel worse

This pattern creates a vicious cycle.

### Breaking the Dance

Pursuers need to:
- Give space without abandoning
- Self-soothe rather than seeking reassurance
- Trust that distancer will return
- Respect the need for processing time

Distancers need to:
- Communicate when leaving ("I need 20 minutes")
- Actually return as promised
- Understand pursuit comes from fear
- Learn to stay engaged longer before breaking

Both need to meet in the middle.

## Attachment and Conflict

### How Attachment Affects Conflict

Your attachment style shows up in conflict:

**Anxious attachment:**
- Hypervigilant to signs of disconnection
- Pursues intensely
- Needs reassurance
- May escalate to get response
- Fears abandonment

**Avoidant attachment:**
- Uncomfortable with emotional intensity
- Withdraws under pressure
- Needs space
- May minimize issues
- Fears engulfment

**Secure attachment:**
- Can tolerate discomfort
- Stays present and engaged
- Balances own needs and partner's
- Trusts resolution is possible
- Doesn't catastrophize

### The Anxious-Avoidant Trap

Anxious + Avoidant = problematic conflict cycle:
- Anxious person pushes for resolution
- Avoidant person retreats
- Anxious escalates, avoidant withdraws more
- Neither gets what they need

Understanding this dynamic helps interrupt it.

## Moving Toward Collaboration

### The Goal

From wherever you start, move toward:
- Expressing your needs without attacking
- Hearing their needs without defending
- Working together toward solutions
- Staying connected through difficulty

This is learnable, regardless of your starting style.

### Style Awareness Helps

When you know your style:
- You can catch yourself
- You can communicate about it
- You can consciously choose differently
- You can ask for what you need

"I notice I'm starting to withdraw. I need 10 minutes, and then I'll come back."

### Growth Takes Time

Changing conflict patterns requires:
- Awareness of current patterns
- Understanding of origins
- Practice with new approaches
- Patience with setbacks
- Often, professional support

You didn't develop your style overnight. It won't change overnight.

<Callout type="important">
Your conflict style isn't your fault. It developed for reasons. But as an adult, you're responsible for understanding it and growing beyond it when it's not serving you. You can change—but first you have to know what you're working with.
