## It's Rarely About What It's About

The thing you're fighting about is rarely the real thing.

Arguments about dishes, money, and time are often really about respect, security, and being valued. The surface issue is the doorway; beneath it lies what actually matters.

Understanding what's really happening transforms how you approach conflict.

---

## Surface vs. Depth

### The Surface Level

What couples fight about:
- Household tasks
- Money and spending
- Time and priorities
- In-laws and family
- Parenting decisions
- Sex and intimacy
- Social plans

These are real issues. But they're usually not the whole story.

### The Deeper Level

What the fights are really about:
- Do you respect me?
- Am I important to you?
- Can I trust you?
- Do you see me?
- Am I safe with you?
- Do you value our relationship?
- Are we a team?

Same argument, much higher stakes.

### Example

**Surface:** "You never empty the dishwasher."

**Underneath:**
- "I feel like I do more, and that's not fair."
- "I feel unseen and taken for granted."
- "I need to know we're partners, not that I'm the maid."
- "I need to matter to you."

The dishwasher is the topic. Mattering is the issue.

## Core Needs in Relationships

### What Everyone Needs

Universal relationship needs:
- **Security:** To feel safe and stable
- **Connection:** To feel close and bonded
- **Respect:** To be valued and treated with dignity
- **Autonomy:** To have space and independence
- **Understanding:** To be seen and known
- **Appreciation:** To be recognized and valued

### Needs in Tension

Sometimes needs conflict:
- Your need for togetherness vs. their need for space
- Your need for security vs. their need for spontaneity
- Your need for acknowledgment vs. their need to not be criticized

This is normal. The needs are all legitimate.

### Unmet Needs Create Conflict

When needs aren't met:
- Frustration builds
- Small issues become big
- Conflicts escalate
- The real need hides behind the complaint

Addressing the surface without addressing the need doesn't resolve anything.

<Exercise title="Finding the Deeper Issue">

Practice identifying what's beneath the surface.

### Part 1: A Recent Conflict

<Journal
  id="wrh-recent"
  prompt="Think about a recent conflict (doesn't have to be major):

• What was the surface issue?
• What emotions came up for you?
• What did you really need in that moment?
• What was at stake beyond the specific issue?
• What might your partner have really needed?"
  placeholder="Surface issue:

Emotions:

What I really needed:

What was really at stake:

What partner might have needed:..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 2: Recurring Conflicts

<Journal
  id="wrh-recurring"
  prompt="Consider conflicts that keep happening:

• What arguments repeat in your relationship(s)?
• What's the surface topic?
• What deeper issue might keep showing up?
• What unmet need might be driving the repetition?
• What would actually address the deeper issue?"
  placeholder="Recurring arguments:

Surface topics:

Unmet need:

What would address it:..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 3: Your Core Needs

<Journal
  id="wrh-needs"
  prompt="Identify your core relationship needs:

• Which needs are most important to you (security, connection, respect, autonomy, understanding, appreciation)?
• When these needs aren't met, how do you react?
• How do you try to get these needs met? (Directly? Indirectly?)
• What does your partner need to know about your needs?"

## Triggers and Wounds

### Why Some Things Hurt More

Certain issues are triggering because they touch old wounds:
- Feeling ignored → old experience of being unseen
- Feeling criticized → old experience of not being good enough
- Feeling controlled → old experience of having no choice
- Feeling abandoned → old experience of being left

The present moment activates the past.

### When It's About More Than Now

Signs you're triggered (not just upset):
- Intensity doesn't match the situation
- Reaction is disproportionate
- Old feelings flood in
- You can't calm down
- It feels like "always" or "never"

This is about old pain, not just current situation.

### Both Things Are True

When triggered:
- Yes, your partner did something
- AND you have a wound that makes it hurt more

Both need addressing:
- Partner's behavior can be discussed
- Your wound is your responsibility to understand

---

## Their Story, Your Story

### Multiple Realities

In conflict, there are always at least two stories:
- What happened from your perspective
- What happened from their perspective
- What actually happened (unknowable)

Both stories have validity. Neither is the complete truth.

### The Fundamental Attribution Error

We tend to:
- Judge ourselves by our intentions
- Judge others by their actions

You know why you did something. You assume their actions reveal their character.

This is usually wrong.

### Curiosity About Their Story

Questions to consider:
- What is this like from their perspective?
- What might they be feeling or needing?
- What could I be missing about their experience?
- What's the most generous interpretation of their behavior?

This doesn't mean you're wrong. It means the picture is incomplete.

## Emotional Escalation

### The Escalation Pattern

How conflicts get worse:
1. Issue arises
2. One person raises it (not always skillfully)
3. Other person reacts (defensively, dismissively)
4. First person escalates (feels unheard)
5. Second person escalates back
6. Regulation goes out the window
7. Things are said that can't be unsaid

### Flooding

When you're "flooded":
- Heart rate rises significantly
- Stress hormones surge
- Rational brain goes offline
- Fight/flight/freeze takes over
- You can't think clearly

Once flooded, nothing productive happens.

### The 20-Minute Rule

When flooded:
- Take a break (minimum 20 minutes)
- Do something calming
- Return when regulated
- Try again from calmer place

You cannot solve problems while flooded.

<Exercise title="Understanding Your Triggers">

Explore your emotional triggers in conflict.

### Part 1: Your Triggers

<Journal
  id="wrh-triggers"
  prompt="Identify your conflict triggers:

• What does your partner do that really gets to you?
• What are the words or tones that escalate you?
• What old experiences might these trigger?
• What are you afraid they mean?
• What do you need when triggered?"
  placeholder="What gets to me:

Words/tones that escalate:

Old experiences triggered:

### Part 2: Flooding Signs

<Journal
  id="wrh-flooding"
  prompt="Recognize your flooding signals:

• What happens in your body when you're flooded?
• What do you think and feel when flooded?
• What do you do when flooded (behaviors)?
• How do you know you've crossed the line?
• What helps you calm down?"
  placeholder="Body when flooded:

### Part 3: Break Protocol

<Journal
  id="wrh-break"
  prompt="Create a break protocol:

• What's the signal that you need a break?
• What will you say to pause without abandoning?
• How long do you need to regulate?
• What will you do during the break?
• How will you return to the conversation?"
  placeholder="Signal I need a break:

What I'll say:

Time needed:

During break:

How I'll return:..."

## Moving to Depth

### How to Get Beneath the Surface

When in conflict:
- Notice the surface issue
- Ask yourself: "What's this really about for me?"
- Identify the underlying need or fear
- Communicate about that, not just the surface
- Get curious about their deeper experience too

"I think I'm upset about the dishes, but really I'm feeling like I don't matter."

### Sharing Your Deeper Truth

Vulnerability transforms conflict:
- "I felt really hurt" is different from "You're inconsiderate"
- "I'm scared you don't care" is different from "You never think about me"
- "I need to feel like a priority" is different from "You always put work first"

Going vulnerable invites connection. Attacking invites defense.

### Asking About Theirs

Invite their depth:
- "What's really going on for you?"
- "What are you needing right now?"
- "Help me understand what this means to you."
- "What am I missing about your experience?"

Genuine curiosity disarms.

## Key Concepts

- **Surface vs. depth:** Fights about dishes are often about respect, mattering, value
- **Core needs:** Security, connection, respect, autonomy, understanding, appreciation
- **Triggers:** Old wounds make current issues hurt more
- **Multiple stories:** Both perspectives have validity; neither is complete
- **Flooding:** Once dysregulated, nothing productive happens; take a break
- **Going deeper:** Share vulnerably; get curious about their experience

<Callout type="important">
The next time you're in conflict, pause and ask: "What is this really about?" The surface issue matters, but the deeper issue is what needs attention. Address that, and the surface often resolves.
</Callout>

*We fight about dishes. We're really fighting about love.*
