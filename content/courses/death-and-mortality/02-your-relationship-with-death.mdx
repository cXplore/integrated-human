## Death Is Personal

Your relationship with death is shaped by:
- Your first encounters with it
- What you were taught (or not taught)
- Your culture and religion
- Who you've lost
- How others around you handled death

**Understanding your relationship with death helps you transform it.**

---

## Early Encounters

For many, death first appeared in childhood:
- A pet died
- A grandparent died
- You saw death on TV or in media
- Someone explained it (or didn't)
- You asked questions and got answers (or silence)

### How It Was Handled:
- Were you allowed to grieve?
- Was death discussed openly?
- Were you told fairy tales to soften it?
- Was it treated as shameful or scary?
- Were you included in rituals?

**How death was handled in childhood affects how you relate to it now.**

## Death and Identity

Death threatens identity—who you are, who you've built yourself to be.

### What Dies With You:
- Your accomplishments
- Your relationships as you know them
- Your body
- Your story
- Your plans
- Your ego

### The Question:
Is there something that doesn't die? Or is death total ending?

Your answer to this shapes everything.

## Religious and Spiritual Views

### Afterlife Views:
- Heaven/Hell (reward/punishment)
- Reincarnation (cycle continues)
- Nirvana (liberation from cycle)
- Ancestor world (joining the dead)

### No Afterlife Views:
- Death is end
- Consciousness ceases
- Only legacy remains
- "Eternal sleep"

### Agnostic/Unknown:
- "I don't know"
- Mystery accepted
- Living without certainty

**You don't need to resolve this. But knowing your view helps.**

## Your Death Stance

After this exploration, what is your current stance?

### Common Stances:
- **Avoidance:** "Don't make me think about it"
- **Fear:** "It terrifies me"
- **Resignation:** "Nothing I can do"
- **Acceptance:** "It's part of life"
- **Engagement:** "Death teaches me how to live"

The goal of this course is to move toward conscious engagement—not morbid obsession, but death as an advisor for life.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Death History:** Your personal encounters with death that shaped your relationship to it.

- **Cultural Programming:** The messages your culture gave you about death.

- **Death Stance:** Your current way of relating to mortality—avoidance, fear, acceptance, engagement.

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll work directly with death anxiety—the fear that arises when facing mortality. You'll learn to be with this fear rather than avoid it.

**Before moving on:**
- Reflect on your death history
- Notice the stance you typically take
- Consider what losses might still need attention

*Your relationship with death was formed before you were conscious of it. Now you can choose how you want to relate.*
