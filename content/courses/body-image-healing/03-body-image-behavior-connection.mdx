## What You Do About How You Feel

Body image doesn't stay in your head. It drives behavior—what you eat, how you move, what you wear, where you go, what you avoid.

Understanding this connection helps you see how much of your life is organized around body image, and opens the possibility of choosing differently.

## Eating Behavior

### How Body Image Affects Food

Body dissatisfaction shapes eating:
- Restriction and dieting
- Avoiding certain foods
- Counting and tracking obsessively
- Eating in secret or alone
- Emotional eating to cope with body distress
- Binge-restrict cycles

The relationship goes both ways: body image affects eating, and disordered eating worsens body image.

### The Diet Cycle

Dissatisfaction often leads to dieting:

1. Feel bad about body
2. Decide to diet
3. Restrict food
4. Initial weight loss, temporary relief
5. Deprivation leads to overeating or bingeing
6. Weight regain (often more than lost)
7. Feel worse about body
8. Diet again

Most diets fail long-term. The cycle repeats.

### Food Morality

Body image creates "good" and "bad" foods:
- Guilt for eating "bad" foods
- Virtue for eating "clean"
- Food becomes moral issue
- Pleasure becomes suspicious
- Eating becomes stressful

Food is fuel and pleasure. It shouldn't be a moral battlefield.

## Movement and Exercise

### Exercise Motivation

Body image shapes why you move:

**Appearance-based motivation:**
- Burn calories
- Change body shape
- Compensate for eating
- Punish self for body
- Earn the right to eat

**Alternative motivations:**
- Feel good
- Manage stress
- Build strength for function
- Enjoy the activity
- Connect with others
- Mental health

Appearance-based motivation is less sustainable and less enjoyable.

### Exercise Patterns

Body dissatisfaction creates problematic patterns:
- Compulsive exercise (can't miss a day)
- Exercise as punishment
- Overtraining
- Ignoring injury or illness
- Hating exercise but doing it anyway
- Exercise to "fix" body

These patterns often lead to burnout, injury, or complete avoidance.

### Exercise Avoidance

Paradoxically, body image can also prevent movement:
- Won't go to gym because of how you look
- Avoid swimming, sports, activities that expose body
- Wait until body is "acceptable" to exercise
- Shame prevents participation

People avoid the activities that might actually help them feel better in their bodies.

## Life Restriction

### What You Avoid

Body image limits life:

**Social situations:**
- Parties and gatherings
- Dating
- Reunions
- Situations where you'll be photographed
- Events requiring certain clothes

**Activities:**
- Swimming or beach
- Sports or fitness classes
- Travel
- Dancing
- Sex and intimacy

**Opportunities:**
- Job interviews
- Public speaking
- Networking
- Leadership roles
- Being visible

### Waiting for the "Right" Body

Many people postpone life:
- "I'll date when I lose weight"
- "I'll go to the beach when I'm thinner"
- "I'll wear that when my body changes"
- "I'll try for that promotion when I look more professional"

Life passes while waiting for a body that may never arrive—or wouldn't change how you feel anyway.

<Exercise title="Mapping Your Body-Behavior Connection">

Examine how body image drives your behavior.

### Part 1: Eating Patterns

<Journal
  id="bb-eating"
  prompt="Explore how body image affects your eating:

• How does how you feel about your body affect what you eat?
• Do you restrict, binge, or both?
• Do you have 'good' and 'bad' foods?
• Do you eat differently when you feel worse about your body?
• What's the emotional relationship between body image and food?"

• What rituals do you have (weighing, checking, measuring)?
• How does what you wear get decided?

## Checking and Avoidance

### Body Checking

Behaviors to monitor and control:

**Visual checking:**
- Mirror checking (frequently, from all angles)
- Checking reflection in windows
- Taking photos to assess body
- Comparing to old photos

**Physical checking:**
- Weighing frequently
- Measuring body parts
- Pinching fat
- Checking how clothes fit
- Feeling bones

**Comparison checking:**
- Comparing to others constantly
- Comparing to old self
- Comparing to images
- Seeking reassurance from others

### Why Checking Backfires

Body checking seems helpful but:
- Provides temporary relief, increases long-term anxiety
- Focuses attention on body, increasing preoccupation
- Never provides lasting reassurance
- Trains the brain to monitor constantly

The more you check, the more you feel you need to check.

### Body Avoidance

The opposite of checking:
- Avoiding mirrors
- Not looking at body
- Wearing clothes that hide body
- Avoiding being photographed
- Not weighing (though this can be healthy too)

Avoidance provides short-term relief but maintains fear.

---

## Compensation and Control

### Compensatory Behaviors

Actions to "undo" or "make up for":
- Exercising after eating
- Restricting after eating "too much"
- Purging (requires professional help)
- Taking laxatives or diet pills
- Over-exercising

These create dangerous cycles and require professional support if present.

### Control as Coping

Body control often serves emotional function:
- Can't control life, can control body
- Manages anxiety through rules and routines
- Creates sense of achievement
- Provides identity and structure

Understanding the function helps address the underlying need.

## The Vicious Cycle

### How Behaviors Maintain Body Image

The behaviors that seem to help actually maintain the problem:

**Restriction:**
- Leads to preoccupation with food
- Often leads to overeating
- Reinforces that body needs fixing
- Increases body focus

**Checking:**
- Trains attention on appearance
- Provides only temporary relief
- Increases body monitoring
- Finds more "flaws"

**Avoidance:**
- Prevents disconfirming evidence
- Maintains fear
- Restricts life
- Reinforces body as problem

**Exercise for appearance:**
- Ties mood to body change
- Never feels like enough
- Makes exercise feel like work
- Unsustainable long-term

These behaviors are understandable responses to distress, but they keep the cycle going.

## Breaking the Connection

### Awareness First

The first step is noticing:
- What behaviors are driven by body image?
- What's the trigger?
- What's the short-term payoff?
- What's the long-term cost?

Awareness creates choice.

### Behavioral Experiments

Try doing things differently:
- What if you didn't check?
- What if you went to the event anyway?
- What if you exercised for enjoyment?
- What if you ate without rules?

Notice what happens. Often the feared outcome doesn't occur.

### Opposite Action

Sometimes healing requires:
- Going to events you'd avoid
- Wearing clothes you've hidden
- Eating foods you've restricted
- Moving joyfully, not punitively
- Looking at your body neutrally

This is exposure work—hard but effective.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Eating:** Body image drives restriction, bingeing, food morality
- **Movement:** Appearance motivation is less sustainable than functional
- **Life restriction:** Avoiding activities, postponing life, waiting for "right" body
- **Checking:** Provides temporary relief, increases long-term anxiety
- **Avoidance:** Maintains fear by preventing new experiences
- **Vicious cycle:** Behaviors meant to help maintain the problem
- **Breaking connection:** Awareness, experiments, opposite action

<Callout type="important">
If you're engaging in compensatory behaviors like purging, laxative use, or compulsive exercise, please seek professional support. These behaviors can be dangerous and require specialized treatment.

*What you do about your body affects how you feel about it. Changing behavior is part of changing the relationship.*
