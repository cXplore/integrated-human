## Beliefs Are Not Facts

You carry beliefs about bodies—what's good, bad, acceptable, shameful. These beliefs feel like truths because you've held them so long.

But beliefs are not facts. They were learned, and they can be questioned.

Challenging body beliefs is cognitive work—examining what you think and testing whether it's actually true or helpful.

---

## Common Body Beliefs

### About Your Own Body

Beliefs you may hold:
- "My body is too [big/small/flabby/bony]"
- "I'm disgusting/gross/ugly"
- "If I could just change [x], I'd be happy"
- "I can't wear [x] with this body"
- "No one could find me attractive"
- "My body is wrong"

These feel like objective observations. They're not.

### About Bodies in General

Broader beliefs:
- "Thin is healthy, fat is unhealthy"
- "Discipline shows in your body"
- "You can tell someone's character by their body"
- "Bodies should look a certain way by a certain age"
- "Some bodies are more valuable than others"

These cultural beliefs shape how you see yourself and others.

### About What Bodies Mean

Interpretations:
- "My body size means I'm lazy/undisciplined"
- "Cellulite means I've failed"
- "Aging is something to fight"
- "Bodies are meant to be attractive to others"
- "My worth is connected to my appearance"

These connect body to character, worth, and identity in ways that aren't actually true.

## Why Beliefs Are Hard to Challenge

### They Feel Like Facts

When you've believed something your whole life:
- It doesn't feel like a belief
- It feels obviously true
- Questioning it feels absurd
- Evidence to the contrary is dismissed

The water you swim in is invisible.

### Confirmation Bias

You notice what confirms beliefs:
- See evidence that supports your view
- Dismiss evidence that contradicts
- Interpret ambiguous situations to fit beliefs
- Remember confirmations, forget exceptions

### Emotional Reasoning

Feelings feel like evidence:
- "I feel fat, therefore I am fat"
- "I feel ugly, therefore I am ugly"
- "I feel disgusted, therefore my body is disgusting"

Feelings are not facts, but they're very convincing.

### Social Reinforcement

Others share your beliefs:
- Diet culture is everywhere
- Body talk is constant
- Weight loss is praised
- Thin ideal is reinforced

When everyone believes something, it must be true—right?

• What do you believe your body says about you as a person?
• What do you believe you need to change?
• Where did each belief come from?"
  placeholder="About my body:

### Part 2: Questioning Beliefs

<Journal
  id="cb-question"
  prompt="Take your strongest negative body belief and question it:

• The belief:
• Is this a fact or an opinion?
• Where did this belief come from?
• Would everyone agree with this belief?
• What evidence contradicts this belief?
• Is this belief helpful to me?
• Would I apply this belief to someone I love?"

• What would a compassionate friend say about your body beliefs?
• How might your body beliefs look from a different cultural perspective?
• What might you believe if you hadn't been exposed to diet culture?
• What's a more balanced way to see your body?"

## Tools for Challenging Beliefs

### The Court Case Method

Put the belief on trial:
- What's the evidence for this belief?
- What's the evidence against?
- What would a fair jury conclude?
- Is the belief proven beyond reasonable doubt?

Usually, harsh body beliefs wouldn't hold up in court.

### The Friend Test

Apply the belief to others:
- Would you believe this about a friend's body?
- Would you say this to someone you love?
- Do you judge others as harshly as yourself?

Often we hold beliefs about our own bodies that we'd never apply to others.

### The Origin Check

Question the source:
- Where did this belief come from?
- Was it taught by someone trustworthy?
- Does the source have a financial interest?
- Is this belief cultural or universal?

Many body beliefs come from diet culture, media, or childhood—not objective truth.

### The Utility Test

Check if the belief helps:
- Does believing this make your life better?
- Does it help you live according to your values?
- Does it improve your health or wellbeing?
- What does this belief cost you?

Even if a belief were true, if it's not helpful, why keep it?

## Specific Beliefs to Challenge

### "Thin = Healthy"

The reality:
- Health exists at every size
- Fitness and weight are not the same
- Behaviors matter more than numbers
- Thin people can be unhealthy
- Larger people can be healthy
- Weight is not fully controllable

Weight is one of many factors—and not the most important.

### "I Can Control My Body's Shape"

The reality:
- Genetics determine much of body shape
- Set point theory: bodies resist change
- 95%+ of diets fail long-term
- Bodies are not infinitely malleable
- Control is mostly an illusion

You can influence health behaviors; you cannot fully control body shape.

### "My Worth Is Tied to My Appearance"

The reality:
- Worth is inherent, not earned
- Appearance is the least interesting thing about people
- Character, actions, relationships matter more
- Appearance-based worth is unstable
- No one on their deathbed wishes they'd been thinner

You are more than a body.

### "Others Are Judging My Body"

The reality:
- People are mostly focused on themselves
- The "spotlight effect"—we overestimate how much others notice us
- Those who judge harshly are struggling too
- Kind people don't evaluate bodies this way
- You can't control others' thoughts anyway

Most people aren't thinking about your body as much as you imagine.

## From Challenging to Replacing

### New Beliefs to Consider

Alternative beliefs about bodies:
- "All bodies are worthy of respect"
- "My body allows me to experience life"
- "Health behaviors matter more than appearance"
- "My worth is not determined by my size"
- "Bodies are meant to change over time"
- "I don't owe anyone beauty"

You don't have to fully believe these yet. Just consider them.

### Working With Resistance

New beliefs may feel:
- Fake or forced
- Like giving up
- Scary or uncomfortable
- Too good to be true

This is normal. Belief change takes time.

### Behavioral Experiments

Test new beliefs through action:
- Act as if you believe your body is acceptable
- Notice what happens when you don't check
- See if feared outcomes actually occur
- Gather evidence against old beliefs

Action often shifts beliefs more than thinking alone.

## Cognitive Distortions About Body

### All-or-Nothing Thinking

- "Either I'm thin or I'm fat"
- "My body is either acceptable or disgusting"
- No middle ground

Reality: Bodies exist on a spectrum. Many things can be true at once.

### Catastrophizing

- "If I gain weight, my life will be ruined"
- "I'll never be able to date with this body"
- Worst-case thinking

Reality: Bodies change all the time. Life continues.

### Mind Reading

- "Everyone is looking at my stomach"
- "They're thinking how fat I am"
- Assuming you know what others think

Reality: You can't read minds. Your assumptions are usually projections.

### Should Statements

- "I should be thinner"
- "My body should look different"
- Rigid rules about how things must be

Reality: Says who? These are opinions, not laws.

### Emotional Reasoning

- "I feel fat, so I am fat"
- "I feel ugly, so I must be"

Reality: Feelings are not facts. You can feel something that isn't true.

## Key Concepts

- **Beliefs vs. facts:** Body beliefs feel like truth but are learned opinions
- **Hard to challenge:** Feel like facts, confirmation bias, emotional reasoning
- **Tools:** Court case method, friend test, origin check, utility test
- **Specific challenges:** Thin = healthy, control, worth tied to appearance
- **Cognitive distortions:** All-or-nothing, catastrophizing, mind reading
- **Replacing beliefs:** New beliefs feel fake at first—this is normal
- **Behavioral experiments:** Action often shifts beliefs faster than thinking

<Callout type="important">
Challenging beliefs is uncomfortable. You may feel resistance, fear, or even like you're "giving up." This discomfort is part of the process. The old beliefs aren't serving you—but they're familiar. New beliefs take time to feel natural.
