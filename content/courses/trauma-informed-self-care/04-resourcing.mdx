## What Resourcing Means

In trauma work, "resourcing" means building internal and external supports that help you regulate and cope.

Before diving into difficult material, you need resources. Without them, processing overwhelms. With them, you have somewhere to return to when things get hard.

**Resources are your anchors. Build them before you need them.**

---

## Types of Resources

### External Resources:
- Safe people
- Safe places
- Objects that comfort
- Animals/pets
- Activities that help
- Nature
- Community

### Internal Resources:
- Memories of safety or competence
- Imagined safe places
- Parts of the body that feel okay
- Breath (when it's calming)
- Self-talk that helps
- Skills you have

---

## Why Resources Matter

### In Difficult Moments:
When triggered or overwhelmed, resources give you somewhere to go—something to return to that helps regulate.

### In Processing:
Trauma processing requires moving in and out of difficult material. Resources are what you move OUT to.

### In Daily Life:
Life is stressful. Resources help you navigate ordinary difficulty, not just trauma-specific overwhelm.

## Building External Resources

### Safe People:
- Who helps you feel calm?
- Who can you call when struggling?
- Who doesn't judge?
- Even one person counts

### Safe Places:
- Where do you feel calmer?
- A room, a spot in nature, a location
- Real places you can go
- It doesn't have to be perfect

### Comfort Objects:
- Something you can touch that soothes
- A blanket, stone, piece of jewelry
- Something from a good time or safe person

### Activities:
- What helps you regulate?
- Walking, creating, cooking, music
- Activities that bring you back to yourself

## Building Internal Resources

### Memories of Safety:
- A time you felt safe, even briefly
- A moment of peace or calm
- A memory of being loved or held

### Memories of Competence:
- A time you handled something hard
- A moment you felt capable
- Evidence that you can cope

### Imagined Resources:
- A place you imagine that feels safe
- A protective figure (real or imagined)
- An inner helper or compassionate presence

### Body Resources:
- A part of your body that feels neutral or okay
- A place you can feel without overwhelm
- An anchor point in your physical self

## The Resource Practice

### How to Use Resources:

**When Regulated:**
Practice accessing resources when you're already okay. This builds the pathway for when you need it.

**When Triggered:**
Call up a resource—person, place, memory, sensation. Let it shift your state.

**In Pendulation:**
Move between difficult feeling and resource. Touch difficulty, return to resource. Repeat.

### The Skill:
Getting good at quickly accessing resources when needed.

---

## Building a Container

### What It Means:
Having enough resources that you can approach difficulty without being overwhelmed.

### The Container Holds:
- You can touch difficult material
- You have somewhere to return to
- You don't flood
- Processing can happen

### Without Container:
- Difficulty overwhelms
- Flooding happens
- Retraumatization risk
- System shuts down

---

## Specific Resource Practices

### Safe Person Practice:
1. Think of a person who feels safe
2. Remember what it's like to be with them
3. Feel their presence in your imagination
4. Notice how your body responds
5. Use this when you need support

### Body Resource Practice:
1. Find a place in your body that feels okay (hand, foot, something)
2. Put your attention there
3. Notice the sensations
4. Let this be an anchor
5. Return to it when overwhelmed

### Memory Resource Practice:
1. Recall a time you felt safe or competent
2. Let the memory be vivid
3. Feel what you felt then
4. Let it affect your current state
5. Use this to counter current difficulty

<Exercise title="Resource Practice">

Try one of the resource practices above. What did you choose? What happened?

</Exercise>

## When Resources Are Hard to Find

### If You Can't Find Any:
- Start very small (one moment, one person, one sensation)
- Look in unexpected places
- Build them going forward
- Therapy can help develop them

### If Resources Are Triggering:
- Some people can trigger safe people resources
- Some memories are mixed
- Find what's clean and simple
- External objects or nature often work when relational resources are complicated

---

## Building Resources Over Time

### Active Building:
- Seek out safe connection
- Create comfort objects intentionally
- Develop activities that regulate
- Practice internal resource access

### Natural Building:
- Notice when something helps
- Mark it as a resource
- Return to it intentionally
- Let your resource library grow

## Key Concepts

- **Resourcing:** Building internal and external supports.

- **External Resources:** People, places, objects, activities.

- **Internal Resources:** Memories, imagined places, body anchors.

- **Container:** Enough resources to approach difficulty without flooding.

- **Practice:** Access resources when regulated, so they're available when triggered.

---

## What's Next

In Module 5, you'll learn about working with your window of tolerance—staying regulated while slowly expanding capacity.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify 3-5 resources
- Practice accessing one
- Notice what helps

---

*Resources are not luxuries. They're necessities. Before you can safely approach difficult material, you need somewhere to return to. Build your anchors now—safe people, safe places, safe memories, safe parts of your body. These become the foundation that allows healing to happen without retraumatization.*
