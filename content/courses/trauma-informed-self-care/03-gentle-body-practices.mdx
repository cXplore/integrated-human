## Approaching the Body Gently

For trauma survivors, the body can be complicated territory. It's where trauma is stored. It might feel unsafe. Connection to it may have been severed.

Returning to the body is important—but it must be done gently, with choice, at a pace that doesn't overwhelm.

**The body is key to healing. And the approach must be trauma-informed.**

---

## The Challenge with Body-Based Practices

### Why It Can Be Hard:
- Body is where trauma is held
- Body sensations can trigger memories
- Feeling the body can feel unsafe
- Loss of control fears
- Dissociation as protection

### The Solution:
- Go slowly
- You stay in control
- Small doses
- Choice at every step
- Resourcing alongside

## Orienting

### A Foundational Practice:
Orienting is simply looking around your environment, noticing where you are.

### How to Do It:
1. Slowly look around the room
2. Notice specific objects
3. Name what you see (silently or aloud)
4. Take your time
5. Let your eyes rest on what feels calming

### Why It Helps:
- Brings you to present moment
- Signals safety to nervous system
- Reminds you that you're here, now
- Very gentle, very doable

---

<Exercise title="Orienting Practice">

Try orienting right now. Slowly look around. Name 5 things you see. How does it feel?

<Journal
  id="orienting"
  prompt="What did you notice when you oriented? What 5 things did you see? How did it feel to look around slowly?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;5 things I saw:&#10;&#10;How it felt:"
  rows={5}

## Grounding

### Connecting to Physical Reality:
Grounding practices help you feel your body's contact with the physical world.

### Simple Grounding:
1. Feel your feet on the floor
2. Notice the pressure, temperature
3. Feel your body in the chair
4. Notice where you're supported
5. Feel your hands—touch something textured

### If Feet or Sitting Feels Unsafe:
- Touch something with your hands
- Hold something cool or warm
- Focus on external senses (what you see, hear)

---

<Exercise title="Grounding Practice">

Try feeling your feet on the floor right now. Really notice the sensation. Then feel your body in the chair.

<Journal
  id="grounding"
  prompt="What did you notice when grounding? Could you feel your feet? Your body in the chair? Was it easy or difficult?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;What I could feel:&#10;&#10;Easy or difficult:"
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

## Gentle Movement

### Movement That Doesn't Overwhelm:

**Key Principles:**
- You're in control
- Go slowly
- Stop when you want
- No "pushing through"
- Follow impulses, not instructions

### Options:

**Slow Walking:**
Feel each step. No destination. Just walking and noticing.

**Gentle Stretching:**
Only stretches that feel good. Stop before any discomfort.

**Shaking:**
Stand and gently shake hands, arms. Let it spread if comfortable. Stop when done.

**Swaying:**
Stand and gently sway. Like a tree in breeze. Whatever feels natural.

---

<Exercise title="Gentle Movement">

<Checklist
  id="movement-options"
  title="Which gentle movements might you try?"
  items={[
    "Slow walking with awareness",
    "Gentle stretching (only what feels good)",
    "Shaking hands and arms",
    "Swaying while standing",
    "Rocking (seated or lying)",
    "Neck rolls (very slow)",
    "Hand and finger movements",
    "Lying down and just noticing body"
  ]}

</Exercise>

## Self-Touch

### Touch That Heals:
Gentle touch can regulate the nervous system. But for trauma survivors, touch—even self-touch—can be complicated.

### Trauma-Informed Self-Touch:
- You choose where
- You choose how much
- You can stop anytime
- Start with "safe" areas (hands, feet, face if okay)

### Options:
- Hand on heart
- Hand on belly
- Rubbing your own hands
- Gentle face touch
- Holding your own hand

### If This Feels Too Much:
Skip it. Work with other practices. Come back when/if it feels right.

<Exercise title="Self-Touch">

<Journal
  id="self-touch"
  prompt="What's your relationship to self-touch? What feels okay? What feels too much? What might you try?"
  placeholder="My relationship to self-touch:&#10;&#10;What feels okay:&#10;&#10;What feels too much:&#10;&#10;What I might try:"

## Breath (Gently)

### The Challenge:
Deep breathing is common advice. But for trauma survivors, focusing on breath can sometimes trigger anxiety or panic.

### Trauma-Informed Approach:
- Don't control the breath—just notice it
- If noticing breath is too much, notice something else
- Very gentle extended exhale (not forced)
- Stop if it increases anxiety

### Simple Practice:
1. Just notice that you're breathing
2. No need to change it
3. If comfortable, let exhale be slightly longer
4. If not comfortable, stop

---

<Exercise title="Breath Awareness">

<Journal
  id="breath-awareness"
  prompt="What happens when you focus on your breath? Does it feel okay? Anxiety-provoking? Neutral? What works for you?"
  placeholder="What happens when I focus on breath:&#10;&#10;How it feels:&#10;&#10;What works for me:"
  rows={5}

</Exercise>

## Sensing the Edges

### A Gentle Body Awareness Practice:

Instead of scanning through the body (which can be overwhelming), sense the edges.

### How to Do It:
1. Notice where your body meets the chair, floor, clothing
2. Feel the boundary of your skin
3. Sense the outline of your form
4. You don't have to go inside—just feel the edge

### Why It Helps:
- Less overwhelming than full body scan
- Creates sense of containment
- Defines where you end
- Easier for dissociative patterns

---

<Exercise title="Sensing Edges">

Try sensing the edges of your body—where you meet the chair, the air, your clothes. What do you notice?

<Journal
  id="sensing-edges"
  prompt="What happened when you sensed your edges? Was it easier than going inside the body? What did you notice?"
  placeholder="What I noticed:&#10;&#10;Was it easier:&#10;&#10;What felt::"
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

---

## When to Stop

### Signs You've Hit Your Edge:
- Anxiety increasing
- Starting to check out/dissociate
- Body tension rising
- Heart racing
- Wanting to escape

### What to Do:
- Stop the practice
- Open your eyes if closed
- Orient to the room
- Ground (feet, chair)
- Don't push through

### This Is Not Failure:
Knowing when to stop IS the practice.

---

## Building a Practice

### Start Small:
- 2-3 minutes of gentle practice
- Once a day if possible
- What feels doable

### Increase Gradually:
- Add time slowly
- Add practices slowly
- Follow your capacity

### Make It Yours:
- What works for YOUR body
- Not what "should" work
- Listen and adjust

---

<Exercise title="Your Gentle Body Practice">

<Journal
  id="body-practice-plan"
  prompt="What gentle body practices will you try? Start small. What feels doable? What might you practice daily?"
  placeholder="Practices I'll try:&#10;&#10;What feels doable:&#10;&#10;Daily practice might look like:"

## Key Concepts

- **Approach Gently:** The body is key, but must be approached with care.

- **You're In Control:** Choice at every step. Stop when needed.

- **Orienting and Grounding:** Foundational, very doable practices.

- **Gentle Movement:** Slow, self-directed, non-overwhelming.

- **Knowing When to Stop:** This is part of the skill.

## What's Next

In Module 4, you'll learn about resourcing—building internal and external supports.

**Before moving on:**
- Try at least one gentle body practice
- Notice what works and what doesn't
- Be gentle with yourself

*The body is not the enemy, even though it may feel that way. The body holds the trauma—and the body holds the healing. Returning to it must be done gently, with full choice and control. You set the pace. You decide what's too much. And slowly, the body becomes safer territory again.*
