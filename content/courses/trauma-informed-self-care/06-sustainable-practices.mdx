## Making It Last

Healing from trauma is not a sprint. It's a long journey that requires sustainable practices—things you can do consistently over time.

This module is about building a routine that supports you without overwhelming you.

**Consistency matters more than intensity. Sustainable beats heroic every time.**

---

## Why Sustainability Matters

### The Problem with Intensity:
- Push too hard → burnout
- Do too much → overwhelm
- Can't maintain → stop entirely
- All or nothing → mostly nothing

### The Power of Consistency:
- Small things add up
- Habits become automatic
- Nervous system learns safety
- Healing happens over time

## Principles of Sustainable Practice

### 1. Small and Doable:
Better 5 minutes you'll actually do than 30 minutes you won't.

### 2. Matched to Capacity:
What can you handle TODAY? That's your practice for today.

### 3. Flexible, Not Rigid:
Hard day? Smaller practice. Good day? Maybe more. Adapt.

### 4. Kind, Not Punishing:
Self-care, not self-discipline. Gentleness, not force.

### 5. Built on What Works:
Use what helps YOU, not what "should" help.

## Building Your Daily Practice

### The Minimum:
What's the smallest practice you could do every day?

### Template:

**Morning (2-5 min):**
- One grounding or orienting practice
- Brief body check-in
- Intention for the day (optional)

**Throughout Day:**
- Notice when you're leaving your window
- Mini-regulation as needed
- Resource access when triggered

**Evening (2-5 min):**
- Brief body check-in
- Release the day
- Something soothing

### Start Here:
Even just a morning check-in is valuable. Start small.

  rows={8}

</Exercise>

## Adaptive Practice

### Matching Practice to State:

**Low Capacity Day:**
- Even smaller practice
- Very gentle
- Maybe just one grounding moment
- No forcing

**Good Capacity Day:**
- Can do more if wanted
- Might try something at edge
- Still sustainable, not heroic

**Crisis Day:**
- Just resources
- Just surviving
- Practice = getting through
- Compassion for yourself

## Common Obstacles

### "I Don't Have Time":
Start with 2 minutes. Everyone has 2 minutes.

### "I Forget":
Attach to existing habit (morning coffee, brushing teeth).

### "It Doesn't Work":
Are you doing what works for YOU? Or what "should" work?

### "I Can't Stay Consistent":
Smaller practice. Lower bar. Compassion when you miss.

### "It Brings Up Too Much":
Gentler practice. Stay in window. Get support.

## Building Slowly

### Week 1-2:
Pick ONE practice. Do it most days. That's it.

### Week 3-4:
If that's stable, add one more thing. Or make it slightly longer.

### Ongoing:
Slowly build, always sustainable. If something drops, that's okay. Pick it up when you can.

### The Rhythm:
Add slowly. Drop and return is normal. Compassion throughout.

---

## Weekly and Monthly Practices

### Beyond Daily:

**Weekly:**
- Longer practice (if capacity allows)
- Connection with support person
- Nature time
- Something restorative

**Monthly:**
- Review what's working
- Adjust practices
- Celebrate progress
- Therapy or professional support

## Self-Compassion in Practice

### When You Miss:
You will miss days. Weeks. This is normal. Don't make it mean you've failed.

### The Response:
"I missed. That's okay. I can start again now." No punishment. No shame spiral.

### The Truth:
Every moment is a new chance to practice. What happened yesterday doesn't determine today.

---

## Long-Term Healing

### What Happens Over Time:
- Window gradually widens
- Triggers become less intense
- Regulation becomes easier
- More capacity for life
- Healing continues

### It's a Journey:
Not a destination. Not a quick fix. A gradual becoming.

### You're Not Behind:
Wherever you are is where you are. Start there.

*Healing from trauma is a marathon, not a sprint. What you need is not heroic effort but gentle consistency. Practices that fit your life, that adapt to your capacity, that you can maintain over the long haul. This is not about pushing through—it's about showing up, again and again, gently. The nervous system learns through repetition. Safety builds through consistency. And over time, healing happens.*
