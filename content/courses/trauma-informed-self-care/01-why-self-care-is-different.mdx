## When Standard Advice Doesn't Work

"Just take a bubble bath." "Practice deep breathing." "Go to yoga."

Standard self-care advice can feel impossible—or even make things worse—when you have trauma. The practices meant to calm everyone else might trigger you, overwhelm you, or leave you feeling more broken because they "don't work."

**You're not broken. Your nervous system is different. You need different care.**

## The Sensitized Nervous System

### What Trauma Does:
Trauma sensitizes your nervous system. It becomes more reactive, more easily triggered, harder to calm.

### How This Shows Up:
- Startle easily
- Difficulty relaxing
- Can't "just calm down"
- Hypervigilance
- Or the opposite: shutdown, numbness
- Swinging between the two

### The Result:
Practices designed for a regulated nervous system can overwhelm a sensitized one.

## Why Standard Self-Care Can Backfire

### "Just Relax":
- Relaxing can feel terrifying when hypervigilant
- Dropping your guard feels unsafe
- The body resists "letting go"

### Deep Breathing:
- Can trigger panic in some trauma survivors
- Focus on body can bring up body memories
- Too much, too fast

### Meditation:
- Sitting still with your thoughts can be overwhelming
- Quieting down can bring up trauma material
- Not designed for dissociation

### Yoga:
- Certain poses can trigger body memories
- Being told what to do with your body
- Group settings may feel unsafe

## You're Not Broken

### The Truth:
Standard advice wasn't designed with trauma in mind. It's not that you're doing it wrong—it's that the advice isn't right for your nervous system.

### What You Need:
- Practices that don't overwhelm
- Going slow enough
- Choice and control
- Safety first
- Titrated approach (small doses)
- Understanding of the sensitized system

## What Is Trauma-Informed Self-Care?

### Definition:
Self-care practices adapted for nervous systems that have been impacted by trauma.

### Key Principles:
1. **Safety First:** Before anything else, establish safety
2. **Choice and Control:** You're always in charge
3. **Titration:** Small doses, not flooding
4. **Pacing:** Slower than you think you need
5. **Window Awareness:** Working within your capacity
6. **Resourcing:** Building support before going into difficult material

## A Note on Safety

### If You Have Significant Trauma:
This course is educational, not therapeutic. For significant trauma, having a therapist or support person is important.

### If Anything Feels Like Too Much:
Stop. Go slower. Skip it. This course is about learning to care for yourself—and that includes caring for yourself while taking this course.

### The Pace:
Go at your pace. There's no rush. Better to go slow and finish than push too hard and stop.

*You've been trying to follow advice that wasn't designed for you. Every time a practice "failed," you may have blamed yourself. But it wasn't failure—it was mismatch. Your nervous system is different. You need different care. This course will show you what that looks like.*
