title: "The Four Masculine Archetypes"
moduleNumber: 2
description: "King, Warrior, Magician, Lover—and their shadows"
duration: "35 min"

## The Archetypal Framework

The psychologist Robert Moore, building on Jung, identified four primary masculine archetypes:

1. **King:** Sovereignty, order, blessing
2. **Warrior:** Action, discipline, boundaries
3. **Magician:** Knowledge, transformation, wisdom
4. **Lover:** Passion, connection, aliveness

Every man has access to all four. The question is whether they're developed, underdeveloped, or in shadow.

**Understanding these archetypes gives you a map for masculine development.**

### The King Energy:
"I am in command of my life. I create order. I bless and empower those in my realm."

### The Tyrant (Inflated):
- Dominating and controlling

- "My way or destruction"

### The Weakling (Deflated):
- Abdicates authority

- Lets others rule his life
- No spine, no standards
- Chaos in his domain

Most men are overdeveloped in some archetypes and underdeveloped in others.

### Common Patterns:

- All in shadow (distorted across the board)

## Key Concepts

- **Four Archetypes:** King, Warrior, Magician, Lover—the fundamental masculine energies.

- **Shadows:** Each archetype has inflated (too much) and deflated (too little) shadows.

- **Balance:** Wholeness comes from developing all four, not just favorites.

- **Development:** Each archetype can be consciously cultivated.

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll work with father wounds—processing what your father couldn't give and how it shaped your masculine development.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify your archetypal strengths and weaknesses
- Notice which shadows are active in your life
- Consider which archetype needs most attention

---

*You have access to all four energies. The work is bringing them into balance—strong where you're weak, conscious where you're shadowed.*
