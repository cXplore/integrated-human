## More Than Death

When we think of grief, we usually think of death. But loss takes many forms, and all loss requires mourning.

You may be grieving:
- A person who died
- A relationship that ended
- A version of yourself
- A dream that won't happen
- A life you expected
- An ability you lost
- A time that's passed

**All grief is real grief.**

## Death

The most recognized form of loss.

### Types of Death Grief:
- Sudden/unexpected death (trauma, accident, suicide)
- Anticipated death (illness, age)
- Ambiguous loss (missing person, dementia)
- Disenfranchised death (stigmatized, unacknowledged)

### Death Grief Includes:
- Loss of the person
- Loss of the future with them
- Loss of the role they played
- Loss of your own identity with them
- Secondary losses (shared friends, home, routines)

---

## Relationship Loss

Divorce, breakups, friendship endings, family estrangement.

### What You Lose:
- The person (or your access to them)
- The relationship you had
- The future you imagined
- Shared identity
- Mutual connections
- Daily rhythms and routines

### Unique Challenges:
- The person is still alive
- No cultural rituals
- Often involves ongoing contact (especially with children)
- May carry blame, anger, or conflict

---

## Identity Loss

Who you used to be is gone.

### Examples:
- Career identity (retirement, job loss, career change)
- Parental identity (empty nest, infertility, estrangement)
- Health identity (illness, disability, aging)
- Relationship identity (newly single, divorced, widowed)
- Youth (aging, menopause, milestone birthdays)

### What You Lose:
- How you knew yourself
- How others saw you
- Sense of purpose
- Place in the world
- Familiar self

---

## Dream Loss

Grief for what never was.

### Examples:
- The family you didn't have
- The career that didn't happen
- The child you couldn't conceive
- The relationship that failed
- The life you expected

### This Is Real Grief:
- You're mourning something that never existed
- It feels less "legitimate" (but isn't)
- Often unacknowledged by others
- Can be surprisingly intense

<Checklist
  id="types-of-loss"
  title="What types of loss are you carrying?"
  items={[
    "Death of someone close",
    "End of a romantic relationship",
    "Friendship that ended or changed",
    "Family estrangement",
    "Career or job loss",
    "Loss of health or ability",
    "A dream that won't happen",

<Journal
  id="main-losses"
  prompt="What are the main losses you're grieving right now? Describe what was lost and what that loss means to you."
  placeholder="The losses I'm carrying:&#10;&#10;1.&#10;&#10;2.&#10;&#10;What these losses mean to me:"
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## Secondary Losses

Every major loss carries secondary losses with it.

### Examples:
When someone dies, you also lose:
- Shared routines
- Plans and future
- Someone who knew your history
- A version of yourself with them
- Sometimes financial stability, home, or community

When a relationship ends, you also lose:
- Mutual friends
- In-laws or their family
- Shared spaces and memories
- Future plans
- Identity as part of a couple

**Naming secondary losses is important. They add to the weight.**

---

<Exercise title="Secondary Losses">

<Journal
  id="secondary-losses"
  prompt="For your main loss, what secondary losses came with it? What else did you lose?"
  placeholder="My main loss was:&#10;&#10;Secondary losses that came with it:&#10;&#10;1.&#10;2.&#10;3.&#10;4.&#10;5."
  rows={10}
/>

## Disenfranchised Grief

Some grief isn't acknowledged by society.

### Examples:
- Loss of a pet
- Miscarriage or infertility
- Suicide or overdose death
- Loss of an affair partner
- Loss of a public figure who mattered
- Grief over news/world events
- Loss related to stigmatized circumstances

### Why It's Hard:
- Others may minimize it
- No cultural permission to mourn
- Shame around the loss
- Grief feels invisible

**Your grief is valid even if others don't acknowledge it.**

---

<Exercise title="Disenfranchised Grief">

<Journal
  id="unacknowledged-grief"
  prompt="Have you experienced grief that felt unacknowledged or minimized by others? What was the loss? How did the lack of acknowledgment affect you?"
  placeholder="A grief that felt unacknowledged:&#10;&#10;How others responded:&#10;&#10;How it affected me:"
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

---

## Anticipatory Grief

Grieving before the loss happens.

### When This Occurs:
- Terminal illness diagnosis
- Dementia progression
- Knowing a relationship will end
- Major life transition approaching

### What It's Like:
- Grieving while the person is still here
- Mourning the person they're becoming
- Pre-grieving the death or ending
- Can feel confusing or premature

**Anticipatory grief is real and valid. It doesn't make the grief after loss any less.**

---

## Accumulated Grief

Sometimes you're carrying more than one loss.

### This Looks Like:
- Losses stacked on each other
- A new loss triggering old unprocessed grief
- Generalized heaviness
- Not knowing what you're grieving

### What Helps:
- Naming each loss
- Allowing space for all of them
- Understanding that grief compounds
- Not judging yourself for the weight

---

<Exercise title="Accumulated Grief">

<Journal
  id="old-losses"
  prompt="What old losses might still be affecting you? What grief from the past never got fully processed?"
  placeholder="Old losses that still affect me:&#10;&#10;Grief that never got processed:&#10;&#10;How I carry this:"
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="current-connection"
  prompt="How might current losses be connected to past losses? Is there a thread?"
  placeholder="Connections between current and past losses:&#10;&#10;The thread might be:&#10;&#10;What this reveals:"
  rows={6}
/>

## Naming What Was Lost

Part of grief work is naming—specifically and clearly—what was lost.

### Not Just:
- "My mom died"

### But Also:
- "I lost the person who knew me longest"
- "I lost the hope she'd finally understand me"
- "I lost my idea of what my future would be"
- "I lost someone to call when things go wrong"

**The more specifically you name your losses, the more fully you can grieve them.**

---

<Exercise title="Naming Losses">

<Journal
  id="specific-naming"
  prompt="For your main loss, name specifically what was lost. Not just the obvious, but all of it. What did you lose?"
  placeholder="What I lost:&#10;&#10;And also...&#10;&#10;And also...&#10;&#10;And the deepest loss might be..."
  rows={12}
/>

</Exercise>

## Key Concepts

- **Many Types of Loss:** Death, relationships, identity, dreams—all require mourning.

- **Secondary Losses:** Every major loss carries additional losses with it.

- **Disenfranchised Grief:** Grief that isn't acknowledged by society is still valid.

- **Anticipatory Grief:** Mourning before loss happens is real grief.

- **Naming Losses:** The more specifically you name what was lost, the more fully you can grieve.

---

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll learn somatic practices for allowing grief to move through your body. Grief lives in the body, and the body needs to express it.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify all the types of loss you're carrying
- Name secondary and accumulated losses
- Give yourself permission to grieve all of it

---

*Every loss deserves mourning—not just the ones others understand.*
