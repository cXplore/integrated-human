## Grief Lives in the Body

Grief isn't just an emotion in your mind. It's a physical experience.

It lives in:
- Heaviness in your chest
- Tightness in your throat
- Aching in your heart
- Fatigue in your limbs
- Tears that want to come

**To process grief, you must feel it in your body and let it move.**

---

## Why the Body Matters

### Grief Gets Stuck
When grief isn't expressed physically, it gets lodged in the body—as tension, illness, or chronic heaviness.

### The Body Knows How
Your body knows how to grieve. Crying, sighing, shaking—these are natural releases. You just need to let them happen.

### Expression Is Release
Moving grief through the body allows it to complete. What gets expressed doesn't stay stuck.

## Practice: Being With Grief

The first practice is simply being with what's there—not fixing, changing, or rushing.

### How to Practice:

1. **Find a Safe Space**
   - Private, comfortable
   - Uninterrupted time
   - Tissues, blanket, comfort items nearby

2. **Tune Into Your Body**
   - Close your eyes
   - Notice where grief lives
   - Place a hand there if it helps

3. **Breathe Into It**
   - Slow, gentle breaths
   - Breathe into the area of sensation
   - Don't force anything

4. **Let It Be**
   - Don't try to change it
   - Don't make it go away
   - Just stay with it

5. **Allow Whatever Arises**
   - Tears, sounds, shaking
   - Memories, images
   - Nothing at all (that's okay too)

## Practice: Crying

Crying is the body's primary grief release. Many people have blocked their crying.

### Permission to Cry:
- It's not weakness
- It's healthy and necessary
- It provides physical relief
- It's okay to cry as much as you need

### If Crying Is Hard:
- Watch sad movies or listen to sad music
- Look at photos or memories
- Give yourself explicit permission
- Find privacy if that helps
- Don't force it—let it come when ready

### While Crying:
- Let it be messy
- Make sounds if they come
- Don't cut it short
- Let waves come and go

## Practice: Sounding Grief

Sometimes grief wants to be voiced—not as words, but as sounds.

### Types of Grief Sounds:
- Sighing
- Moaning
- Wailing
- Keening
- Sobbing sounds
- Primal sounds

### How to Practice:
1. Find a private space (or use a pillow)
2. Let sounds come without words
3. Don't censor or judge the sound
4. Let it be ugly, raw, real
5. Let the body lead

**Many cultures have traditions of wailing and keening. Your voice wants to express grief.**

## Practice: Moving Grief

Sometimes grief needs movement to release.

### Movement Practices:
- **Slow, intuitive movement:** Let your body move however it wants
- **Walking:** Long, slow walks with grief
- **Rocking:** Gentle rocking, like comforting a child
- **Shaking:** Shake out the grief energy
- **Dance:** Moving to sad music

### The Principle:
Follow your body. Let it show you how it wants to move. Grief has a rhythm that's different from everyday movement.

## Practice: Breathing with Grief

Breath can help grief move.

### How to Practice:

**Extended Exhale:**
- Breathe in for 4 counts
- Breathe out for 6-8 counts
- The long exhale activates calm

**Sighing:**
- Take a deep breath
- Let it out with an audible sigh
- Repeat several times

**Belly Breathing:**
- Breathe into your belly
- Let the diaphragm fully expand
- Breathe grief into and out of the body

## Practice: Writing Grief

Writing can be a physical release.

### Practices:

**Stream of Consciousness:**
- Write without stopping for 10-20 minutes
- Don't edit or judge
- Let grief pour onto the page

**Letters:**
- Write to the person/thing you lost
- Say everything you need to say
- No need to send

**Poetry:**
- Let grief find its own form
- Don't worry about quality
- Let words capture feeling

---

<Exercise title="Writing Practice">

<Journal
  id="grief-letter"
  prompt="Write a letter to what you've lost. Say what you need to say. What do you miss? What do you wish you'd said? What do you still carry?"
  placeholder="Dear...&#10;&#10;"
  rows={15}
/>

</Exercise>

## Grief in Doses

You don't have to feel all your grief at once.

### Dose It:
- Set a timer (10-30 minutes)
- Let yourself fully feel during that time
- Then come back to daily life
- Return to grief when ready

### This Is Healthy:
- You need to function
- Processing happens in waves
- You can visit grief without living there
- Integration happens over time

---

## After Grief Expression

After a grief session, care for yourself:

### What Helps:
- Rest and quiet
- Warm bath or shower
- Gentle movement
- Time in nature
- Nourishing food
- Comfort objects
- Gentle company or solitude

### What to Avoid:
- Jumping back into busy-ness
- Numbing immediately
- Harsh self-judgment
- Too much stimulation

## Key Concepts

- **Grief in the Body:** Grief is physical and lives in the body as sensation.

- **Being With:** The first practice is simply staying present with grief without trying to change it.

- **Physical Release:** Crying, sounding, and moving allow grief to move through.

- **Dosing Grief:** You can feel grief in manageable doses rather than all at once.

- **Aftercare:** Taking care of yourself after grief expression supports integration.

## What's Next

In Module 4, you'll explore complicated grief—when grief gets stuck or tangled due to unfinished business, ambivalence, or trauma.

**Before moving on:**
- Try at least one somatic practice
- Notice where grief lives in your body
- Give yourself permission to cry or sound

---

*Grief needs to move through you. Let your body lead. It knows how to release what it's been holding.*
