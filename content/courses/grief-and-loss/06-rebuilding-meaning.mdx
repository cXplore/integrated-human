## After Loss

Loss changes you. You can't go back to who you were before.

The question isn't how to return to the old life. It's how to build a new one—one that integrates the loss into who you're becoming.

**Rebuilding isn't forgetting. It's carrying what you loved forward.**

---

## Meaning-Making After Loss

When loss happens, meaning shatters. Things that made sense no longer do.

### What Gets Disrupted:
- Sense of safety and predictability
- Beliefs about fairness and justice
- Assumptions about how life works
- Identity and role
- Future plans and expectations

### Rebuilding Meaning:
- Finding what still holds true
- Discovering new meaning
- Integrating loss into your story
- Letting the loss change you

---

## Two Types of Meaning

### Sense-Making:
- Understanding why it happened
- Finding cause or explanation
- May or may not be possible
- Not always necessary for healing

### Benefit-Finding:
- Finding value despite the loss
- Growth that came from pain
- What you learned or became
- Can coexist with grief

**You don't have to find meaning in the loss. You can find meaning after and through the loss.**

<Journal

  placeholder="What's emerging:&#10;&#10;What I've learned:&#10;&#10;How I've changed:&#10;&#10;(Or: Nothing yet, and that's okay)"
  rows={8}

## You Are Changed

Loss changes you. This is not bad—it's reality.

### Ways You Might Be Changed:
- Deeper empathy for others' pain
- Reordered priorities
- Less patience for superficiality
- Greater appreciation for what remains
- New understanding of impermanence
- More connection to what matters

### The Challenge:
- The old you is gone
- The new you is emerging
- The transition is disorienting
- You're grieving yourself too

<Exercise title="How You've Changed">

<Journal
  id="how-changed"
  prompt="How has this loss changed you? What's different about who you are now versus before?"
  placeholder="How I've changed:&#10;&#10;What's different about me:&#10;&#10;What I value now that I didn't before:&#10;&#10;What matters less:"
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Continuing Bonds

You don't have to "let go" completely. Modern grief research supports continuing bonds with what was lost.

### This Means:
- They're still part of you
- You carry them forward
- The relationship continues (in new form)
- You talk to them, think of them, include them

### Healthy Continuing Bonds:
- Bring comfort, not only pain
- Allow you to function
- Coexist with new relationships
- Evolve over time

---

<Exercise title="Continuing Bonds">

<Journal
  id="continuing-relationship"
  prompt="How might your relationship with what you lost continue? In what ways do they remain part of your life?"
  placeholder="How the relationship continues:&#10;&#10;Ways they remain part of my life:&#10;&#10;What I carry forward:"
  rows={8}

## Post-Traumatic Growth

Some people experience growth after loss. This is real, but:

### Important Truths:
- Growth doesn't cancel grief
- You can grow AND still hurt
- Growth is not required
- Some losses don't produce growth
- Growth doesn't justify the loss

### Types of Growth:
- Greater appreciation for life
- New priorities
- Enhanced relationships
- Discovery of personal strength
- Spiritual development
- New possibilities

**If growth happens, let it. If it doesn't, that's also okay.**

---

## Rebuilding Life

Eventually, life needs to be rebuilt—practically and spiritually.

### Practical Rebuilding:
- New routines and rhythms
- Changed roles and responsibilities
- Decisions about belongings, spaces, relationships
- Financial and logistical adjustments

### Spiritual Rebuilding:
- New sense of self
- Updated beliefs and meaning
- Changed relationships
- New purposes and directions

### The Pace:
- There's no timeline
- Don't rush
- Small steps count
- It's okay to not know what's next

  id="rebuilding-practical"

## Honoring While Moving Forward

You can move forward while still honoring what was lost.

### This Looks Like:
- New joys that include grief
- New relationships that don't replace old
- Changed life that carries the loss
- Living fully while still mourning

### Moving Forward Is Not:
- Forgetting
- Betrayal
- Replacing
- Getting over it

**You can love what was, grieve its loss, and build a new life. All at the same time.**

---

## Legacy and Purpose

Some people find purpose through loss.

### Questions:
- What did they teach you?
- What would they want for you?
- How can their life continue to matter?
- What can you do in their honor?
- How can this loss serve something larger?

### Examples:
- Charitable work in their name
- Living values they embodied
- Helping others with similar losses
- Creating something in their memory
- Living more fully because of what you learned

---

<Exercise title="Legacy and Purpose">

<Journal
  id="legacy"
  prompt="What legacy do you want to carry forward from what was lost? What did they teach you? What would they want for you?"
  placeholder="What they taught me:&#10;&#10;What they would want for me:&#10;&#10;How I can honor their legacy:"
