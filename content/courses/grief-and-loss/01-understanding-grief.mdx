## Welcome

If you're here, you're carrying loss.

This course is a companion for that carrying—not to fix your grief, not to make it go away, but to help you move through it with understanding and care.

**Grief is not a problem to solve. It's a process to honor.**

---

## What Is Grief?

Grief is the natural response to loss. It's how we process what's been taken, ended, or changed.

Grief includes:
- Emotional pain (sadness, anger, longing)
- Physical sensations (heaviness, fatigue, tightness)
- Cognitive changes (confusion, difficulty concentrating)
- Spiritual questioning (meaning, purpose, "why")
- Changes in behavior (withdrawal, restlessness)

**Grief is not a sign of weakness or a failure to "move on." It's a sign that something mattered.**

---

## Grief Is Not Depression

Though they can look similar, grief and depression are different:

### Grief:
- Connected to specific loss
- Comes in waves
- Includes moments of joy or peace
- Tied to memory and meaning
- Generally decreases over time

### Depression:
- Pervasive hopelessness
- Constant rather than wavelike
- Little relief
- Often without specific cause
- Doesn't improve without treatment

**Grief can lead to depression, but grief itself is natural and necessary.**

## Why We Avoid Grief

Culture teaches us to avoid grief:

### Cultural Messages:
- "Be strong" (don't feel)
- "Move on" (don't dwell)
- "They're in a better place" (don't question)
- "Keep busy" (don't stop)
- "You should be over it by now" (don't take time)

### Personal Avoidance:
- It hurts too much
- Fear of being overwhelmed
- Belief it will never end
- Not knowing how to grieve
- No permission or support

## The Cost of Unexpressed Grief

Grief that doesn't move through gets stuck.

### Where It Goes:
- Body (tension, illness, fatigue)
- Emotions (depression, anxiety, numbness)
- Behavior (addiction, withdrawal, irritability)
- Relationships (distance, conflict)
- Life (feeling stuck, loss of meaning)

**Unexpressed grief doesn't disappear. It compounds.**

---

## The "Stages" of Grief

You may have heard of the "stages of grief" (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance).

### The Truth:
- These aren't linear stages
- You don't go through them in order
- You can feel multiple at once
- You may cycle through repeatedly
- Some you may not experience at all

**Grief is not a checklist. It's a process as unique as you are.**

## What Grief Actually Feels Like

Grief often includes:

### Waves:
- Intense emotion that rises and falls
- Triggered by reminders
- Less frequent over time but can still hit hard

### Physical Sensations:
- Heaviness, pressure, tightness
- Fatigue, low energy
- Difficulty sleeping or eating
- Sighing, crying, physical aching

### Mental Fog:
- Difficulty concentrating
- Forgetfulness
- Confusion
- Time distortion

### Emotional Range:
- Sadness and longing
- Anger and irritability
- Guilt and regret
- Relief (sometimes)
- Fear and anxiety
- Moments of peace

## Grief Is Love

At its core, grief is love—love with nowhere to go.

### Consider:
- You grieve because you loved
- The depth of grief reflects the depth of connection
- Grief is the price of caring
- It's love continuing beyond loss

**You wouldn't want to not grieve. That would mean not having loved.**

---

## What Grief Needs

Grief needs:

### Space:
- Time to feel
- Permission to grieve
- Room for the process

### Expression:
- Ways to move the emotion
- Speaking, crying, writing
- Physical release

### Witness:
- Being seen in grief
- Not alone in the pain
- Someone who can hold space

### Meaning:
- Making sense of the loss
- Finding what endures
- Integration into life

## Permission to Grieve

This course gives you permission:

- To feel what you feel
- To take the time you need
- To grieve in your own way
- To not be okay
- To honor what was lost

**There's no timeline for grief. There's no right way to do it. There's only your way.**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Grief Is Natural:** It's the normal response to loss, not a pathology.

- **Grief vs. Depression:** Grief is wavelike and loss-specific; depression is pervasive and often needs treatment.

- **Unexpressed Grief:** What doesn't move through gets stuck in body, mind, and life.

- **Grief as Love:** Grief is love continuing—the price of connection.

- **No Timeline:** There's no right way or right length of time to grieve.

---

## What's Next

In Module 2, you'll explore the many types of loss that require mourning—not just death, but divorce, identity, dreams, and more. Recognizing what you're grieving is the first step to processing it.

**Before moving on:**
- Acknowledge you're carrying grief
- Notice how you've avoided or expressed it
- Give yourself permission to feel what you feel

---

*Grief isn't something to get over. It's something to get through. And you don't have to do it alone.*
