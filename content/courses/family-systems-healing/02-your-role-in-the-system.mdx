## You Had a Job

Every child in a family has a job. Not a literal job—no one assigns it consciously. But a function that emerges to serve the system's needs.

This role shaped how you developed. It became part of your identity. You may still be playing it decades later.

Understanding your role is essential for freedom from it.

## Why Roles Develop

Roles emerge for several reasons:

### To Manage Anxiety

Families have anxiety. About money, about relationships, about the future, about unprocessed past. Children absorb this anxiety and develop roles to manage it.

One child becomes the responsible one, carrying the family's need for stability. Another becomes the problem child, giving the family something concrete to focus on. Another becomes invisible, requiring nothing.

### To Fill Gaps

What the parents can't do, a child often does.

If mom is emotionally unavailable, a child might become the emotional caretaker. If dad is irresponsible, a child might become hyper-responsible. If the marriage is empty, a child might become a substitute partner.

Children fill gaps they shouldn't have to fill.

### To Express the Unspoken

What can't be spoken in a family often gets expressed through a child.

The family's hidden rage comes out as the child's behavioral problems. The family's unacknowledged grief manifests as a child's depression. The family's denied chaos appears as a child's anxiety.

Children become symptom-bearers for the system.

### To Maintain Homeostasis

Roles stabilize the system. Even when they hurt the individuals playing them.

The scapegoat keeps the focus off the marriage problems. The hero keeps the family's image intact. The lost child doesn't add to the burden. Each role serves the system's need for equilibrium.

## The Complexity of Roles

### Multiple Roles

Most people don't fit neatly into one role. You might be the hero in some ways and the caretaker in others. Roles can shift over time or with different family members.

### Role Rigidity

In healthier families, roles are flexible. Children can try different ways of being. In dysfunctional families, roles become rigid. You become locked into your function.

### Sibling Complementarity

Siblings often take complementary roles. If one is the hero, another might become the scapegoat. If one is visible, another becomes invisible. It's as if the roles balance each other.

### Gender and Birth Order

Role assignment is influenced by gender expectations and birth order, though not determined by them. Firstborns often get hero or caretaker roles. Boys and girls may be channeled into different functions.

## How Roles Persist

The role you developed in childhood likely continues today, unless you've done significant work to change it.

**With family:** When you're with your family of origin, you probably fall back into your role automatically. The system pulls you back.

**In relationships:** You recreate your role in adult relationships. Caretakers find people to caretake. Heroes perform. Scapegoats get blamed.

**At work:** Your role shapes your work patterns. Heroes overachieve. Lost children stay invisible. Mascots deflect.

**Internally:** Even alone, you relate to yourself through your role. Heroes push themselves. Lost children neglect their own needs.

<Exercise title="Identifying Your Role">

Explore the role(s) you played in your family system.

### Part 1: Role Recognition

<Journal
  id="role-primary"
  prompt="Identify your primary role in your family of origin:

Review the roles described (Hero, Scapegoat, Lost Child, Mascot, Caretaker):

• Which role(s) resonate most with your experience?
• How did this role manifest in your family?
• Who assigned or reinforced this role?
• What was the payoff for playing this role?
• What was the cost?"
  placeholder="The role(s) I recognize...

How it manifested...

Who reinforced it...

The payoff...

The cost..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 2: The Function You Served

<Journal
  id="role-function"
  prompt="Explore the function your role served:

• What problem in the family did your role solve or manage?
• What would have happened if you didn't play this role?
• What anxiety or dysfunction did your role absorb?
• How did your role stabilize the system?
• What was the unspoken agreement?"
  placeholder="The problem my role managed...

If I hadn't played this role...

What I absorbed...

How I stabilized things...

The unspoken agreement..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 3: How Your Role Shaped You

<Journal
  id="role-shaped"
  prompt="Examine how this role shaped your development:

• How did this role shape your identity?
• What aspects of yourself were developed by this role?
• What aspects were suppressed or undeveloped?
• How does this role show up in your current life (relationships, work, self-relationship)?
• What would you be like without this role?"
  placeholder="How it shaped my identity...

What was developed...

What was suppressed...

How it shows up now...

Without this role, I might be..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 4: Sibling Roles

<Journal
  id="role-siblings"
  prompt="If you have siblings, explore their roles:

• What role did each sibling play?
• How did your roles relate to each other (complementary? competitive?)
• How did your role define you in contrast to them?
• What happened when someone stepped out of their role?
• How do these dynamics persist today?"
  placeholder="Sibling roles...

How our roles related...

How I was defined against them...

## Beyond the Role

Your role was a survival strategy. It helped you adapt to your family system. In that sense, it served you.

But you are not your role.

The hero can be ordinary. The scapegoat can be good. The lost child can be seen. The mascot can be serious. The caretaker can receive.

These feel impossible because the role feels like identity. It's not. It's a pattern that developed in response to a system.

The work ahead involves:
1. Seeing the role clearly
2. Understanding its function
3. Recognizing its current manifestations
4. Consciously choosing different behaviors
5. Developing parts of yourself the role suppressed

- **Lost Child:** Disappears to not add burden
- **Mascot:** Provides relief through humor and entertainment
- **Caretaker:** Takes care of parents or siblings
- **Role persistence:** Roles continue into adulthood unless consciously examined

## What's Next

In Module 3, we'll explore intergenerational patterns—how what happened generations ago still affects you today.

Before moving on, spend time with the role identification exercises. This understanding is foundational for the work ahead.
