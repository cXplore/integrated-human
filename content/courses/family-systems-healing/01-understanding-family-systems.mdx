## Beyond Individual Psychology

Most of psychology focuses on individuals. Your thoughts, your feelings, your history, your patterns.

But there's a problem with this approach: you didn't develop in isolation. You grew up inside a system—a family—and that system shaped everything about who you became.

To understand yourself fully, you need to understand the system you emerged from.

## What Is a Family System?

A family system is more than a collection of individuals living together. It's an interconnected unit where:

- Each member affects all other members
- The whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- Patterns maintain themselves across time
- Change in one part affects the entire system

Think of a mobile—the kind that hangs over a baby's crib. Touch one piece and the whole thing moves. Families work the same way.

## Core Principles of Family Systems

### 1. Interconnection

What happens to one member affects all members.

When dad loses his job, mom becomes anxious. When mom is anxious, the kids act out. When the kids act out, dad feels like more of a failure. The cycle reinforces itself.

This isn't about blame. It's about recognizing that family members exist in constant, mutual influence.

### 2. Homeostasis

Systems seek stability. Even dysfunctional stability.

A family develops patterns over time. These patterns—however unhealthy—become "normal." The system will resist changes that threaten this stability, even positive changes.

This is why:
- When one person gets healthier, other family members may sabotage
- When someone tries to change, they get pulled back to old patterns
- Even painful dynamics persist because they're familiar

### 3. Roles and Functions

Each family member serves a function in the system.

These roles aren't consciously chosen. They emerge to serve the family's needs:
- Who carries the anxiety?
- Who provides the stability?
- Who expresses what can't be spoken?
- Who distracts from deeper problems?

You had a role. You may still be playing it.

### 4. Boundaries

Families have boundaries—around the family and between members.

**Enmeshed families:** Boundaries too loose. Members are over-involved in each other's lives. Difficult to have separate identities.

**Disengaged families:** Boundaries too rigid. Members are disconnected. Difficult to get needs met within the family.

**Healthy families:** Flexible boundaries. Connection AND separateness. Members can be close without losing themselves.

### 5. Triangles

When anxiety arises between two people, they often involve a third person to stabilize.

Mom is angry at dad. She confides in daughter. Now daughter is in the middle—carrying anxiety that isn't hers.

Two siblings are fighting. They pull in a parent. Now the parent is triangulated.

Triangles reduce anxiety temporarily but spread it through the system. They're everywhere in families.

## Anxiety and the Family System

Anxiety is the engine of most family dysfunction.

When anxiety is high, people:
- React rather than respond
- Fall into rigid roles
- Triangle in others
- Repeat old patterns
- Lose ability to think clearly

The family system manages anxiety in predictable ways:
- Conflict (fighting to discharge tension)
- Distance (withdrawal to avoid tension)
- Overfunctioning/underfunctioning (one person does more, another less)
- Triangling (spreading tension to third parties)
- Focusing on a child (child becomes the "problem")

These aren't conscious strategies. They're automatic responses that develop over time.

---

## Multigenerational Transmission

Patterns don't just exist in your immediate family. They come from generations before.

What your grandparents didn't resolve, they passed to your parents. What your parents didn't resolve, they passed to you.

This includes:
- Attachment patterns
- Ways of handling emotions
- Relationship blueprints
- Unprocessed trauma
- Core beliefs about self and world

You're not just dealing with your parents. You're dealing with generations of unfinished business.

## Why This Matters

Understanding family systems matters because:

**It reduces blame.** You stop seeing individuals as "the problem" and start seeing patterns that involve everyone.

**It increases compassion.** You understand why your parents did what they did—they were shaped by their families too.

**It creates change points.** When you see the system, you can identify where to intervene.

**It frees you.** Understanding the system is the first step to not being run by it unconsciously.

<Exercise title="Mapping Your Family System">

Begin understanding your family as a system.

### Part 1: The Family Unit

<Journal
  id="family-members"
  prompt="Describe your family of origin:

• Who were the members? (Include anyone who lived with you or was significantly present)
• What was the general 'feel' of the family?
• What was spoken about? What was never spoken about?
• What was the family's relationship with the outside world?
• What would an outsider notice about your family?"
  placeholder="Family members...

The general feel was...

What was spoken about...

What was never spoken about...

Relationship with outside world...

What an outsider would notice..."
  rows={16}
/>

### Part 2: Patterns and Dynamics

<Journal
  id="family-patterns"
  prompt="Identify common patterns in your family:

• What happened when there was conflict?
• What happened when someone was anxious or upset?
• Who was close to whom? Who was distant?
• Were there alliances or coalitions?
• What were the recurring themes, fights, or issues?
• How did the family handle stress?"
  placeholder="When there was conflict...

When someone was upset...

Who was close/distant...

Alliances...

Recurring themes...

How stress was handled..."
  rows={16}
/>

### Part 3: Boundaries

<Journal
  id="family-boundaries"
  prompt="Assess boundaries in your family:

• Were boundaries enmeshed (too loose), disengaged (too rigid), or flexible?
• Could you have privacy? Separate thoughts? Your own life?
• Was it okay to be different from the family?
• Was it okay to have needs?
• What happened when someone set a boundary?"
  placeholder="Type of boundaries...

Privacy and separateness...

Being different...

Having needs...

When boundaries were set..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 4: Triangles

<Journal
  id="family-triangles"
  prompt="Identify triangles you were part of or witnessed:

• Were you ever put in the middle of your parents' relationship?
• Did you align with one parent against another?
• Were siblings triangled into parental conflicts?
• Who talked to whom about whom?
• What role did you play in these triangles?"
  placeholder="Being in the middle...

## The System You Emerged From

You were shaped by a system. That system had its patterns, its anxieties, its unfinished business.

Understanding this isn't about blame. Your parents were shaped by their systems too. And their parents before them.

It's about seeing clearly. When you see the system, you begin to have choice about whether to continue its patterns.

In the next module, we'll look specifically at the role you played—the function you served in your family system.

## Key Concepts

- **Family system:** An interconnected unit where members mutually influence each other
- **Homeostasis:** The system's tendency to maintain stability, even dysfunctional stability
- **Triangles:** Involving a third party to manage anxiety between two people
- **Multigenerational transmission:** Patterns passed down across generations
- **Boundaries:** The degree of separateness between family members

*To understand yourself, understand the system that made you.*
