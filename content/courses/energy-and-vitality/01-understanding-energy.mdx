## The Energy Problem

You're tired. Not just physically tired—depleted at a deeper level. The fatigue doesn't fully lift with sleep. Coffee helps for an hour, then you crash.

This isn't about willpower or motivation. Something is genuinely draining you.

**This course is about finding what's actually depleting you and learning to build genuine vitality.**

## Beyond Physical Energy

Energy isn't just calories and rest. You have multiple energy systems:

### Physical Energy
- Food, sleep, movement
- What most people focus on
- Important but not the whole picture

### Mental Energy
- Focus, attention, decision-making
- Limited capacity per day
- Depleted by constant demands

### Emotional Energy
- Processing feelings
- Suppressing feelings costs more
- Relationships require emotional energy

### Nervous System Energy
- Regulating stress responses
- Constant activation depletes
- Recovery is essential

### Spiritual/Purpose Energy
- Alignment with meaning
- Doing what matters
- Misalignment drains

**When people are chronically exhausted, the problem is usually not physical. It's in these other systems.**

## What Drains Energy

### Physical Drains:
- Poor sleep
- Inadequate nutrition
- Lack of movement
- Illness and inflammation
- Substances (alcohol, drugs)

### Mental Drains:
- Constant decisions
- Information overload

- Lack of focus

### Emotional Drains:
- Suppressed emotions

### Nervous System Drains:
- Chronic stress

- No recovery time
- Trauma activation
- Living in survival mode

### Alignment Drains:
- Wrong job/career
- Against your values
- Unfulfilled purpose
- Living someone else's life
- Inauthenticity

## The Energy Equation

Think of energy like a bank account:

### Deposits:
- Rest, nourishment, movement
- Connection, meaning, play
- Aligned living, authentic expression

### Withdrawals:
- Stress, demands, labor
- Suppression, conflict, misalignment
- Constant giving without receiving

### Balance:
If withdrawals exceed deposits over time, you deplete. Many people are operating in chronic deficit.

### The Goal:
More deposits, fewer withdrawals. Simple in concept, requires changes in practice.

---

## The Fatigue Epidemic

You're not alone. Chronic fatigue is epidemic:
- Modern work demands constant output
- Technology eliminates recovery
- Culture values productivity over rest
- Nervous systems evolved for different world
- Emotional labor goes unrecognized

**Understanding that the environment is part of the problem can reduce self-blame. But you still need strategies.**

---

## Medical Causes

Before focusing on lifestyle, ensure you've ruled out medical causes:

### To Check:
- Thyroid function
- Iron/anemia
- Vitamin deficiencies (B12, D)
- Blood sugar issues
- Sleep disorders
- Chronic infections
- Autoimmune conditions

**If fatigue is severe and persistent, see a doctor. This course addresses the non-medical causes.**

## Key Concepts

- **Multiple Energy Systems:** Physical, mental, emotional, nervous system, alignment/purpose.

- **Energy Equation:** Deposits vs. withdrawals. Chronic deficit leads to depletion.

- **Hidden Drains:** Emotional, nervous system, and alignment drains often cause fatigue blamed on physical factors.

- **Genuine Vitality:** Not caffeine-fueled productivity, but sustainable aliveness.

- **Systemic Problem:** Modern life creates energy drain; individual strategies are needed but it's not your fault.

---

## What's Next

In Module 2, you'll explore nervous system drain—how chronic stress exhausts you and what to do about it.

**Before moving on:**
- Complete the energy audit honestly
- Identify your top drains
- Consider what fills you that you're not doing enough of

*Fatigue isn't a character flaw. It's feedback. Something in your life is draining more than it should, or filling less than it could. Let's find out what.*
