## Managing, Not Just Having

Energy isn't just something you have or don't have—it's something you manage.

Like money, you can:
- Spend it wisely or waste it
- Budget for what matters
- Save for important things
- Recognize when you're low
- Make deposits and withdrawals strategically

**Energy management is a skill. This module teaches it.**

## Your Energy Rhythm

Everyone has a natural energy rhythm:

### Typical Pattern:
- Morning rise (after waking)
- Mid-morning peak (often highest)
- After-lunch dip
- Afternoon recovery
- Evening decline
- Wind-down toward sleep

### Your Unique Pattern:
Not everyone follows this. Some are:
- Morning people (early peak)
- Night owls (late peak)
- Steady throughout

### Know Your Pattern:
Track your energy for a week. When are you highest? Lowest?

<Exercise title="Mapping Your Energy">

<Journal
  id="energy-pattern"
  prompt="Describe your typical energy pattern through the day:
• When do you have most energy?
• When do you dip?
• When is your best focus time?
• When do you crash?"
  placeholder="Morning:&#10;&#10;Late morning:&#10;&#10;After lunch:&#10;&#10;Afternoon:&#10;&#10;Evening:"
  rows={10}
/>

<Checklist
  id="energy-type"
  title="Which best describes you?"
  items={[
    "Morning person - best energy early",
    "Night owl - best energy later",
    "Steady - fairly consistent throughout",
    "Variable - depends on many factors"
  ]}
/>

</Exercise>

## Matching Tasks to Energy

The key insight: **Match your tasks to your energy level.**

### High Energy = Hard Work:
- Complex thinking
- Creative work
- Important decisions
- Challenging conversations
- Learning new things

### Low Energy = Easy Work:
- Routine tasks
- Administrative work
- Email (maybe)
- Organizational tasks
- Mindless but necessary work

### The Mistake:
Many people waste high-energy time on email and meetings, then try to do creative work when depleted.

---

## Protecting Peak Hours

Your highest-energy hours are precious. Protect them.

### How to Protect:
- Block calendar for important work
- Say no to meetings in peak time
- Turn off notifications
- Create physical boundaries
- Communicate to others

### What to Avoid:
- Email first thing (steals morning energy)
- Back-to-back meetings in peak hours
- Interruptions during best focus time
- Low-value tasks during high-energy periods

## Energy Recovery Throughout Day

Don't wait until evening to recover. Build recovery into your day.

### Micro-Recoveries (1-5 minutes):
- Breath break
- Standing and stretching
- Looking out window
- Brief walk
- Eye rest from screens

### Mini-Recoveries (10-20 minutes):
- Walk outside
- Proper break (not working break)
- Lying down
- Nature exposure
- Meditation

### Mid-Day Recovery:
- Lunch away from desk
- Post-lunch walk
- Brief nap (20 min if possible)
- Real transition time

---

## Managing Energy Dips

When you hit a low point:

### In the Moment:
- Movement (walk, stretch)
- Breath activation
- Fresh air
- Cold water on face
- Brief change of context
- Healthy snack if needed

### Prevention:
- Don't schedule hard work for known dips
- Take breaks before you're depleted
- Maintain blood sugar stability
- Stay hydrated
- Get enough sleep (prevents afternoon crash)

---

## Decision Fatigue

Every decision uses energy. By end of day, decision quality drops.

### Managing Decisions:
- Make important decisions when fresh
- Reduce trivial decisions (routines, habits)
- Batch decisions (all similar at once)
- Plan decisions in advance
- Know when you're fatigued and delay

### Reducing Daily Decisions:
- Meal planning
- Consistent routines
- Standard workflows
- Automated choices
- Less options in general

---

## Energy Budgeting

Think about energy like a budget:

### Daily Budget:
- You have a certain amount each day
- Spending it all leaves nothing
- Overspending creates debt (next day deficit)
- Under-spending can create excess (rarely a problem)

### Weekly Budget:
- Intense days need recovery days
- All intense = crash
- Balance demanding and restorative
- Weekly rhythm matters

### Seasonal Considerations:
- Busy periods need planned recovery after
- Vacations should actually recover
- Life events require energy reserves

---

<Exercise title="Energy Budgeting">

<Journal
  id="budget-typical"
  prompt="How do you typically spend your energy in a day? Where does it go?"
  placeholder="My energy typically goes to:&#10;&#10;Morning:&#10;&#10;Work:&#10;&#10;Relationships:&#10;&#10;Other:"

<Journal

  prompt="Ideally, how would you budget your energy? What would change?"
  placeholder="Ideally, I would spend energy on:&#10;&#10;What would change:"

Energy management is ongoing practice, not a one-time fix.

**Remember:**
- Your energy is precious—treat it that way
- Match tasks to energy levels
- Build recovery into every day
- Address drains, not just symptoms
- Vitality is possible

**You don't have to be tired. Energy is your birthright.**
