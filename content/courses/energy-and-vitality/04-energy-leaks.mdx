## What Is an Energy Leak?

An energy leak is anything that consistently drains you without proportional return—something that takes more than it gives.

### Types of Leaks:
- **Relationships** that deplete you
- **Commitments** you resent
- **Habits** that drain
- **Physical spaces** that exhaust
- **Mental patterns** that consume energy

**Finding and plugging these leaks can free enormous energy.**

## Relationship Leaks

Some relationships drain; others fill. Know the difference.

### Draining Relationships:
- You always give, never receive
- You feel worse after contact
- They don't respect boundaries
- Drama and crisis are constant
- You're their therapist, not their friend
- You suppress yourself around them

### Filling Relationships:
- Mutual give and take
- You feel energized after
- They respect your boundaries
- Support flows both ways
- You can be yourself
- Connection feeds you

<Exercise title="Relationship Energy Audit">

List the key relationships in your life and assess their energy impact:

<Journal
  id="relationship-list"
  prompt="List 10 key relationships (family, friends, colleagues, etc.) and rate each as: FILLS (+), DRAINS (-), or NEUTRAL (0)"
  placeholder="1.&#10;2.&#10;3.&#10;4.&#10;5.&#10;6.&#10;7.&#10;8.&#10;9.&#10;10."
  rows={12}
/>

<Journal
  id="relationship-drains"
  prompt="For the relationships marked as drains: What specifically is draining about them? Why do you maintain them?"
  placeholder="What's draining:&#10;&#10;Why I maintain them:"
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Dealing with Draining Relationships

### Options:
1. **Set boundaries** to reduce drain
2. **Change the dynamic** (communicate needs)
3. **Reduce contact** if possible
4. **End the relationship** if necessary
5. **Accept with awareness** if ending isn't possible

### Questions to Ask:
- Is this relationship essential? (family, work)
- Can boundaries reduce the drain?
- Is change possible?
- What would I need to let go?

**You don't have to stay in every draining relationship. You do have to handle essential ones better.**

## Commitment Leaks

Things you've committed to that now drain you:

### Examples:
- Volunteer work you resent
- Clubs or groups you've outgrown
- Projects you don't believe in
- Obligations out of guilt
- Subscriptions and memberships unused
- Social commitments you dread

### The Pattern:
- Said yes when should have said no
- Stayed past the expiration date
- Maintain out of obligation, not desire
- Each "yes" steals energy

---

<Exercise title="Commitment Audit">

<Journal
  id="commit-list"
  prompt="List your current commitments: work, volunteer, social, personal projects, memberships, etc. Mark which FILL you vs. DRAIN you."
  placeholder="Commitments that fill me:&#10;&#10;Commitments that drain me:"
  rows={10}
/>

<Journal
  id="commit-release"
  prompt="Which draining commitments could you reduce or end? What's stopping you?"
  placeholder="I could release:&#10;&#10;What's stopping me:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Habit Leaks

Everyday habits that drain without you noticing:

### Common Energy-Draining Habits:
- Checking phone constantly
- News/social media scrolling
- Staying up too late
- Skipping meals or eating poorly
- Caffeine cycles (up, crash, repeat)
- Numbing with TV/substances
- Not exercising
- Chronic complaining

### Why They Persist:
- Temporary relief
- Addictive design (apps, substances)
- Unconscious patterns
- Avoiding something harder

### The Drain:
These habits might feel neutral or even good in the moment, but they deplete over time.

<Exercise title="Habit Audit">

<Checklist
  id="habits-drain"
  title="Which draining habits do you have? (Check all that apply)"
  items={[
    "Checking phone first thing in morning",
    "Constant phone checking throughout day",
    "Excessive social media scrolling",
    "News consumption beyond staying informed",
    "Staying up past my best bedtime",
    "Skipping meals or eating poorly",
    "Too much caffeine",
    "Numbing with TV/streaming",
    "Alcohol or substances",
    "Complaining or venting excessively",
    "Not moving my body",
    "Procrastinating then stressing"
  ]}

<Journal
  id="habits-cost"
  prompt="For your worst energy-draining habits: What do they cost you? Why do you keep doing them?"
  placeholder="The cost:&#10;&#10;Why I keep doing them:"
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Physical Space Leaks

Your environment affects your energy:

### Draining Spaces:
- Cluttered, chaotic
- Dirty or disorganized
- Poor lighting or air
- Uncomfortable
- Full of unfinished projects
- Things that remind you of what you should do

### Energy-Supporting Spaces:
- Clean and organized
- Comfortable and inviting
- Good light and air
- Things you love
- Supports your activities
- Feels like sanctuary

---

## Mental Pattern Leaks

Thoughts can drain energy too:

### Draining Mental Patterns:
- Worry and rumination
- Perfectionism
- Self-criticism
- Catastrophizing
- Comparison
- Resentment loops
- Unfinished decisions

### The Cost:
Mental energy spent on these patterns isn't available for living.

---

<Exercise title="Comprehensive Leak Inventory">

<Journal
  id="leak-summary"
  prompt="Summarize your energy leaks across all categories:
• Relationship leaks
• Commitment leaks
• Habit leaks
• Space leaks
• Mental pattern leaks"
  placeholder="Relationship leaks:&#10;&#10;Commitment leaks:&#10;&#10;Habit leaks:&#10;&#10;Space leaks:&#10;&#10;Mental pattern leaks:"
  rows={15}
/>

</Exercise>

## Plugging the Leaks

### The Process:
1. **Identify** the leak (done above)
2. **Assess** the cost vs. difficulty of change
3. **Decide** what to address first
4. **Act** to plug or reduce the leak
5. **Notice** the energy freed

### Prioritization:
Start with:
- Biggest drains
- Easiest to change
- Most under your control

### Some Leaks Take Time:
- Ending relationships requires care
- Habits need replacing, not just stopping
- Commitments may need graceful exit
- Patterns need awareness and practice

---

<Exercise title="Leak Plugging Plan">

<Journal
  id="plug-priority"
  prompt="Which 3 energy leaks will you address first? Why these?"
  placeholder="1.&#10;&#10;2.&#10;&#10;3.&#10;&#10;Why these:"
  rows={10}
/>

<Journal
  id="plug-action"
  prompt="For each priority leak, what specific action will you take? When?"
  placeholder="Leak 1 - Action:&#10;&#10;Leak 2 - Action:&#10;&#10;Leak 3 - Action:"
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## Learning to Say No

Many leaks come from inability to say no.

### Why No Is Hard:
- Fear of rejection
- People-pleasing
- Guilt
- Not wanting to disappoint
- Fear of conflict
- Unclear priorities

### Learning No:
- Every yes is a no to something else
- Your energy is finite
- No is protection, not selfishness
- "No" now saves resentment later
- A clear no is kinder than a reluctant yes

---

## The Freed Energy

When you plug leaks:
- Energy becomes available
- You feel lighter
- More capacity for what matters
- Less resentment
- More presence
- Better health

**This is often the easiest place to find energy—not adding practices, but removing drains.**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Energy Leak:** Anything that consistently drains more than it gives.

- **Relationship Audit:** Assessing which relationships fill vs. drain.

- **Commitment Clearing:** Releasing obligations that no longer serve.

- **Habit Awareness:** Recognizing everyday patterns that deplete.

- **Saying No:** Essential skill for preventing future leaks.

---

## What's Next

In Module 5, you'll learn to build genuine vitality—practices that create sustainable energy.

**Before moving on:**
- Complete your comprehensive leak inventory
- Begin plugging your priority leaks
- Practice saying no to one thing

---

*Sometimes the path to more energy isn't adding—it's subtracting. Plug the leaks before trying to fill the tank.*
