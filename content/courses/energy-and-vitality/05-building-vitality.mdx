## Beyond Not Being Tired

Vitality isn't just "not exhausted." It's aliveness, energy, life force.

You're not aiming for:
- Baseline functioning
- Caffeine-sustained productivity
- Survival mode

You're aiming for:
- Genuine aliveness
- Sustainable energy
- Enthusiasm for life
- Reserve capacity

**This is possible. It requires building, not just fixing.**

## Sleep: The Foundation

Sleep is the primary recovery period. Nothing replaces it.

### Sleep Hygiene:
- Consistent sleep/wake times
- Dark, cool room
- No screens 1 hour before bed
- No caffeine after noon
- Calming pre-sleep routine
- Comfortable sleep environment

### Sleep Quality:
- Deep sleep matters most

### Sleep Priority:
Many people sacrifice sleep for productivity. This is backwards—sleep enables productivity.

## Nourishment

Food is fuel, but also more than fuel.

### Principles:
- Real food (minimally processed)
- Adequate protein
- Vegetables and fiber
- Healthy fats
- Hydration
- Eating for energy (vs. comfort, distraction)

### What Drains:
- Sugar spikes and crashes
- Highly processed foods
- Eating too much or too little
- Caffeine dependency
- Alcohol effects

### Eating Patterns:
- Regular meals (blood sugar stability)
- Eating when hungry, stopping when full
- Present with food (not distracted)

---

## Movement

The body is designed to move. Sedentary life drains.

### Movement for Energy:
- Regular, not extreme
- Something you enjoy
- Mix of types (strength, cardio, flexibility)
- Movement throughout day, not just gym

### Movement Benefits:
- Circulates energy
- Releases tension
- Improves sleep
- Regulates mood
- Builds physical capacity

### Avoiding Depletion:
- Too much exercise drains
- Listen to body's need for rest
- Balance intensity with recovery

## Joy and Play

Vitality requires joy—not just absence of suffering.

### The Problem:
Many adults have forgotten how to play. Life became all obligation.
