## Mapping Your Pattern

General knowledge about anxiety is useful. But to really work with YOUR anxiety, you need to understand YOUR specific pattern.

Anxiety has a structure. It follows predictable sequences. When you can see the pattern clearly, you gain leverage you didn't have before.

This module is about mapping your unique anxiety signature.

---

## The Anxiety Cycle

Every anxiety response follows a similar cycle:

```
TRIGGER
   ↓
PHYSICAL SENSATIONS
   ↓
THOUGHTS / INTERPRETATIONS
   ↓
EMOTIONS
   ↓
BEHAVIORS / COPING
   ↓
(Often feeds back to more anxiety)
```

Each person's version of this cycle is unique. Your triggers aren't mine. Your physical symptoms differ from someone else's. Your thoughts are your own.

Let's map each element.

---

## Triggers

Triggers are what sets off your anxiety. They can be:

### External Triggers
- **Situations:** Social events, work meetings, crowded places
- **People:** Certain individuals, authority figures, strangers
- **Places:** Specific locations, enclosed spaces, heights
- **Events:** Deadlines, transitions, unexpected changes
- **Stimuli:** Sounds, smells, images that activate threat response

### Internal Triggers
- **Body sensations:** Heart racing, dizziness, shortness of breath
- **Thoughts:** "What if" scenarios, memories, catastrophic predictions
- **Emotions:** Other emotions (like anger) that trigger anxiety
- **States:** Tiredness, hunger, hangover, hormonal changes

### Contextual Factors
Triggers often have context. You might be fine giving a presentation to your team but terrified presenting to executives. You might handle one stressor but collapse when multiple stack up.

**The more precisely you identify your triggers, the better you can work with them.**

## Physical Symptoms

Anxiety lives in the body. Everyone experiences it differently.

### Common Physical Symptoms:

**Cardiovascular:**
- Racing heart
- Pounding heart
- Chest tightness
- Blood pressure changes

**Respiratory:**
- Shortness of breath
- Shallow breathing
- Hyperventilation
- Feeling like you can't get enough air

**Muscular:**
- Tension (shoulders, jaw, neck)
- Trembling
- Weakness in legs
- Restlessness, can't sit still

**Digestive:**
- Nausea
- Stomach upset
- Loss of appetite
- Need to use bathroom

**Neurological:**
- Dizziness
- Lightheadedness
- Feeling faint
- Tingling or numbness
- Headaches

**Temperature:**
- Hot flashes
- Cold chills
- Sweating

**Other:**
- Dry mouth
- Lump in throat
- Blurred vision
- Feeling unreal

**Your specific symptom pattern is important.** Some people get chest tightness; others get stomach upset. Knowing your pattern helps you recognize anxiety early and intervene.

## Thoughts

Anxious minds produce anxious thoughts. Common patterns:

### Catastrophizing
Jumping to the worst-case scenario. "If I don't do this perfectly, I'll be fired, become homeless, and die alone."

### Fortune-telling
Predicting negative outcomes with certainty. "I know this will go badly."

### Mind-reading
Assuming you know what others think (and that it's negative). "Everyone can see how anxious I am. They think I'm pathetic."

### Overestimating Probability
Believing the bad thing is more likely than it actually is. "This plane will definitely crash."

### Underestimating Coping
Believing you can't handle what might happen. "If I have a panic attack, I won't survive it."

### What-iffing
Endless "what if" scenarios, each worse than the last. "What if I fail? What if they judge me? What if I embarrass myself?"

### All-or-nothing
No middle ground. "If I'm not completely calm, I'm completely falling apart."

**These thoughts feel true. But they're anxiety distortions, not reality.**

---

## Emotions

Anxiety is often layered with other emotions:

- **Fear** — The core emotion of threat
- **Dread** — Anticipation of something bad
- **Panic** — Intense, overwhelming fear
- **Worry** — Rumination about future problems
- **Shame** — "Something is wrong with me"
- **Frustration** — "Why can't I just be normal?"
- **Despair** — "This will never change"

Noticing the emotional texture of your anxiety helps you work with it more precisely.

---

## Behaviors and Coping

How do you respond to anxiety?

### Avoidance
- Not going to places or events
- Not starting conversations
- Not pursuing opportunities
- Calling in sick
- Canceling plans

### Escape
- Leaving early
- Making excuses to get out
- "Irish exits"
- Fleeing mid-panic

### Safety Behaviors
- Carrying anxiety medication "just in case"
- Always having water nearby
- Sitting near exits
- Having a "safe person" with you
- Checking things repeatedly

### Control Behaviors
- Over-preparing
- Rehearsing conversations
- Arriving excessively early
- Controlling environment obsessively

### Numbing
- Alcohol or drugs
- Eating
- Scrolling
- Dissociating
- Zoning out

### Reassurance-seeking
- Asking others if everything is okay
- Seeking confirmation repeatedly
- Googling symptoms

### Helpful Behaviors
You may also have genuinely helpful coping:
- Breathing exercises
- Talking to supportive people
- Physical activity
- Mindfulness practices

**Map your full range of responses—both helpful and unhelpful.**

---

## The Feedback Loops

Anxiety creates feedback loops that maintain itself:

### Physical Feedback
Shallow breathing → Less oxygen → More anxiety symptoms → More shallow breathing

### Cognitive Feedback
Anxious thought → Body activation → More anxious thoughts → More activation

### Behavioral Feedback
Avoidance → Relief → Confirmation that trigger is dangerous → More anxiety next time

### Emotional Feedback
Anxiety → Shame about being anxious → More anxiety about the shame

**When you see the loops, you can intervene at any point.**

---

## Early Warning Signs

Your anxiety doesn't go from 0 to 100 instantly. There are usually early signs—if you learn to notice them.

### Physical Early Signs
- Slight tension increase
- Breathing changes
- Stomach flutter
- First heart rate increase

### Mental Early Signs
- First "what if" thought
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mind jumping to threat
- Starting to plan escape

### Behavioral Early Signs
- Checking phone more
- Getting quieter
- Physical restlessness
- Starting to avoid

**Catching anxiety early is much easier than catching it late.** The earlier you intervene, the less it escalates.

## Key Insights from Your Map

Now that you've mapped your pattern, notice:

### Intervention Points
Every step in the sequence is an intervention point. You can work with:
- The trigger (sometimes)
- Physical symptoms (very workable)
- Thoughts (workable with practice)
- Behaviors (highly workable)

### Your Personal Leverage Points
Some intervention points work better for you than others. Some people do well with breath work; others need cognitive work first. Your map reveals your leverage.

### The Pattern's Logic
Your pattern has internal logic. Given your triggers and history, the response makes sense—even if it's not helpful. Seeing this logic increases compassion and understanding.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Anxiety has structure** — it follows predictable sequences you can map
- **Your pattern is unique** — specific triggers, symptoms, thoughts, behaviors
- **Early warning signs** — catching anxiety early is much easier than catching it late
- **Feedback loops** — anxiety maintains itself through physical, cognitive, and behavioral loops
- **Intervention points** — every element of the sequence is a potential point of leverage

## What's Next

In Module 3, we dive deep into panic attacks—what they are, what's actually happening in your body, and how to navigate them. Even if you don't have full panic attacks, understanding the panic mechanism helps with all anxiety.

Before moving on, complete the full mapping exercise. This is reference material you'll use throughout the course.

*When you can see the pattern, you're no longer trapped inside it.*
