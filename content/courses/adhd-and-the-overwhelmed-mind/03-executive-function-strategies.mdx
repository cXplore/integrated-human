## Working With Your Brain

Standard productivity advice often fails people with ADHD because it's designed for neurotypical brains.

Effective ADHD strategies work *with* how your brain functions, not against it. They externalize what the ADHD brain struggles to internalize.

Here are practical approaches for the main executive function challenges.

## Task Initiation

### The Challenge

Starting tasks—especially non-preferred ones—is often the hardest part. You might:
- Stare at the task for hours without starting
- Start everything except the important thing
- Wait until deadline panic forces action
- Need the "right" conditions that never come

### Strategies

**Reduce the starting step:**
- "I'll just open the document"
- "I'll work for 2 minutes"
- Make the first step absurdly small

**Use transition rituals:**
- Same music or sound to signal "work time"
- Physical movement before sitting down
- Coffee or tea as a transition marker

**Create urgency:**
- Body doubling (working alongside someone)
- Accountability partners
- Public commitments
- Artificial deadlines

**Catch the wave:**
- When you feel impulse to start, drop everything and start
- Don't wait for the "right" time
- Use the motivation when it appears

**Environmental cues:**
- Task materials visible and ready
- Reduce barrier to starting
- Close unrelated tabs/apps first

## Sustaining Attention

### The Challenge

Even after starting, maintaining attention is difficult:
- Mind wanders constantly
- Distractions derail you
- You forget what you were doing
- Interest fades quickly

### Strategies

**Structure environment:**
- Remove distractions (phone in another room)
- Use website blockers
- Create a dedicated workspace
- Noise-canceling headphones or background noise

**Use time containers:**
- Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break)
- Shorter intervals if needed (15 min, 10 min)
- Timer makes time visible
- Built-in breaks prevent burnout

**Increase stimulation:**
- Background music or sounds
- Standing or walking while working
- Fidget tools
- Novelty and variety within the task

**External accountability:**
- Body doubling (in-person or virtual)
- Co-working sessions
- Check-ins with others

**Return protocol:**
- When you notice you've wandered, gently return
- No judgment—just return
- Leave visible notes about where you were

## Working Memory

### The Challenge

Working memory holds information while you use it. ADHD working memory challenges mean:
- Forgetting what you were about to do
- Losing track mid-task
- Forgetting instructions
- Difficulty juggling multiple pieces of information

### Strategies

**Externalize everything:**
- Write it down immediately
- Don't trust memory—trust systems
- Capture tools always accessible (phone notes, small notebook)

**Visual reminders:**
- Sticky notes in your line of sight
- Whiteboards
- Physical objects as reminders

**Simplify information:**
- One task at a time
- Break complex instructions into steps
- Immediately write down verbal instructions

**Use checklists:**
- Step-by-step for routine processes
- Reduces memory load
- Provides structure to return to

**Close loops quickly:**
- Do small tasks immediately if possible
- Don't rely on remembering later
- "If it takes 2 minutes, do it now"

## Planning and Organization

### The Challenge

Creating and following plans is difficult:
- Difficulty breaking down big tasks
- Can't see the steps to get from here to there
- Overwhelmed by complexity
- Plans feel abstract

### Strategies

**Make plans visible and physical:**
- Paper calendars/planners you'll see
- Wall calendars
- Physical lists vs. hidden digital ones

**Break down everything:**
- "Do project" → List every specific step
- Each step should be concrete action
- First step should be clear

**Time blocking:**
- Schedule when you'll do things
- Treat with yourself like appointments
- Put everything on the calendar

**Weekly review:**
- Regular time to plan the week
- Look at what's coming
- Adjust as needed

**Planning support:**
- Body double while planning
- Coach or accountability partner
- Planning buddy

**Templates and routines:**
- Standard processes for recurring tasks
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Don't reinvent each time

---

## Time Management

### The Challenge

Time blindness makes time management particularly hard:
- Can't estimate how long things take
- Lose track of time
- Always late or rushing
- Deadlines don't feel real until imminent

### Strategies

**Make time visible:**
- Analog clocks (visual time passing)
- Time Timer or similar visual timers
- Clocks in every room

**Use alarms liberally:**
- Alarm to start getting ready
- Alarm when you should leave
- Alarm for transitions
- Multiple alarms for important events

**Time estimation practice:**
- Guess how long something will take
- Track actual time
- Build awareness over time

**Build in buffer:**
- Assume things take longer than expected
- Add 50% to estimates
- Schedule less than you think you can do

**Transition warnings:**
- 10-minute and 5-minute warnings before stopping
- Helps with ADHD difficulty transitioning

**Anchor time to events:**
- "After breakfast, I'll..."
- "When my partner leaves, I'll..."
- Tie abstract time to concrete happenings

## The Meta-Strategy

### Systems, Not Willpower

The meta-strategy: rely on systems, not willpower.

Willpower is:
- Limited
- Depleted by other demands
- Inconsistent
- Already taxed by having ADHD

Systems are:
- External
- Always there
- Not affected by your state
- Doing the remembering and organizing for you

Invest in building systems. They're worth the upfront effort.

### Start Somewhere

You don't need to implement everything at once. That's a recipe for overwhelm.

Pick:
- One area that's causing most problems
- One or two strategies to try
- One week to test them

Adjust and add more over time.

### Experiment

What works for one ADHD brain may not work for another.

Approach strategies as experiments:
- Try something
- Notice what happens
- Keep what works, drop what doesn't
- Try something else

There's no perfect system—only the one that works for you.

## Key Concepts

- **Task initiation:** Reduce starting step, create urgency, catch the wave
- **Sustaining attention:** Structure environment, time containers, body doubling
- **Working memory:** Externalize everything, visual reminders, close loops
- **Planning:** Make visible, break down, weekly review
- **Time management:** Make time visible, alarms, buffers
- **Meta-strategy:** Systems over willpower, experiment, start somewhere

<Callout type="important">
Strategies work best alongside appropriate treatment. If you're not on medication and struggling significantly, consider discussing options with a provider. For many people, medication makes other strategies more effective.

*Your brain struggles to internalize executive functions. So externalize them. That's not cheating—it's intelligence.*
