## Design, Don't Force

The key to living well with ADHD isn't trying harder with systems designed for other brains. It's designing systems that work with your brain.

This requires knowing how your brain works—and designing around it, not against it.

## Principles of ADHD-Friendly Design

### Make It Visible

Out of sight is out of mind—literally. ADHD brains don't maintain internal representations of invisible things.

**Applications:**
- Important things in your line of sight
- Visual calendars and lists
- Transparent containers
- Notes on mirrors and doors
- Clocks everywhere
- Open shelving vs. closed drawers

### Make It Easy

The activation energy to do something matters more for ADHD brains. Every barrier reduces chance of action.

**Applications:**
- Remove friction from desired behaviors
- Add friction to undesired ones
- One-step is better than two
- Pre-prepare (clothes ready, materials out)
- Default settings matter

### Make It Novel

ADHD brains seek novelty. Routine becomes invisible—in a bad way.

**Applications:**
- Change things up before they become stale
- Rotate systems when they stop working
- Don't commit to one "right" way
- Use variety as a feature

### Make It Interesting

Interest drives the ADHD brain more than importance.

**Applications:**
- Gamify boring tasks
- Add music, challenge, variety
- Find the interesting angle
- Pair unpleasant with pleasant
- Reward systems that actually motivate you

### Make It External

Don't rely on internal motivation, memory, or executive function. Externalize.

**Applications:**
- External reminders (alarms, people, environment)
- External accountability (body doubling, coaches)
- External memory (written systems)
- External structure (scheduled time)

### Make It Forgiving

Systems will fail sometimes. Rigid systems crash; flexible ones bend.

**Applications:**
- Reset days built in
- Easy to resume after lapse
- No all-or-nothing
- Compassion for imperfection

## Key Life Systems

### Morning Routine

The morning sets the day. Build a routine that:
- Has minimal decisions
- Happens automatically
- Gets essentials done
- Doesn't rely on remembering

**Example elements:**
- Clothes laid out the night before
- Medication in visible place with water
- Keys, wallet, phone in one designated spot
- Checklist by the door
- Minimal options, maximum automation

### Workspace

Where you work affects whether you work.

**ADHD-friendly workspace:**
- Distraction minimized (or right kind of stimulation)
- Materials visible and accessible
- Different zones for different work
- Movement options (standing desk, exercise ball)
- Clocks visible
- Minimal clutter (or tolerance for clutter if it works)

### Task Management

A system for tracking what needs to be done.

**What works for ADHD:**
- Single capture place (not multiple lists)
- Visible, not hidden in app
- Simple (complex systems get abandoned)
- Includes when, not just what
- Regular review built in

**Options to try:**
- Paper planner (visible)
- Whiteboard
- Simple digital tool (Todoist, Things)
- Bullet journal
- Index cards

### Time Management

Working with time blindness.

**ADHD-friendly:**
- Visual timers
- Multiple alarms
- Time blocking (tasks assigned to time)
- Buffer time built in
- Transition rituals
- Anchor to events, not clock times

### Finances

Financial management requires executive function ADHD struggles with.

**ADHD-friendly:**
- Automate everything possible (bills, savings)
- Reduce accounts and cards
- Visual tracking
- Regular money date with yourself
- Alerts for unusual activity
- Simple categories

### Home Management

Maintaining a home requires ongoing executive function.

**ADHD-friendly:**
- "A place for everything" (reduce decision load)
- Visible storage
- Reduce stuff (less to manage)
- Cleaning as routine, not special event
- Small regular tasks vs. big infrequent ones
- Lower standards where possible

---

## Building Habits

### Why ADHD Struggles with Habits

Habits are automatic behaviors that don't require conscious effort. They rely on:
- Consistent repetition
- Consistent context
- Working memory (to remember the behavior)
- Self-monitoring

ADHD challenges all of these. Habits are harder to form.

### Habit Strategies

**Link to existing anchors:**
- After coffee, I'll...
- Before I leave, I'll...
- When my partner gets home, I'll...

**Start absurdly small:**
- One push-up, not a workout
- One sentence, not a chapter
- One dish, not the kitchen

**Make the cue obvious:**
- Put the thing where you'll see it
- Set alarms
- Use environmental triggers

**Stack on successful habits:**
- Add new habit to existing routine
- Build incrementally

**Track visibly:**
- Mark off completed days
- Visible streak
- Satisfaction of checking off

**Expect setbacks:**
- Habits will break
- This isn't failure
- Just restart

<Exercise title="Designing Your Systems">

Create ADHD-friendly systems for your life.

### Part 1: Audit Current Systems

<Journal
  id="systems-audit"
  prompt="Assess your current systems:

For each area, rate how well it's working (1-10) and note what's problematic:
• Morning routine:
• Task management:
• Time management:
• Finances:
• Home management:
• Work/productivity:

What patterns do you notice about what's working and what isn't?"

What's problematic:

Task management: _/10

### Part 2: Redesign Priority Area

<Journal
  id="systems-redesign"
  prompt="Pick your most problematic area and redesign:

Area to redesign:

Applying ADHD-friendly principles:
• How will you make it visible?
• How will you make it easy?
• How will you make it interesting?
• How will you make it external?
• How will you make it forgiving?

What's your new system?"

### Part 3: Implementation Plan

<Journal
  id="systems-implementation"
  prompt="Plan your implementation:

• When will you set up the new system?
• What materials or tools do you need?
• What might get in the way?
• How will you handle when it fails?
• How long will you test before adjusting?
• Who can provide accountability?"

## When Systems Fail

### They Will Fail

No system works forever with ADHD. Expect:
- Novelty wearing off
- Forgetting the system exists
- Life changes making it irrelevant
- Random abandonment

This isn't failure—it's the nature of ADHD.

### What to Do

**Don't shame yourself:**
- This is expected
- You didn't fail; the system stopped working

**Assess what happened:**
- Did it stop working, or did you stop using it?
- What changed?
- Was it ever really working?

**Iterate:**
- Adjust the system
- Try something different
- Keep what worked, change what didn't

**Accept the cycle:**
- Systems will be adopted, used, abandoned, replaced
- This is normal
- The goal is a series of working systems, not one permanent one

---

## Key Concepts

- **Design principles:** Visible, easy, novel, interesting, external, forgiving
- **Key systems:** Morning routine, workspace, tasks, time, finances, home
- **Habits:** Harder for ADHD—link to anchors, start small, track, expect setbacks
- **System failure:** Expected, not shameful—iterate and replace
- **The goal:** Systems that work *for now*, not permanent solutions

<Callout type="important">
What works for other people may not work for you. What works for you now may not work later. This isn't failure—it's how ADHD brains interact with systems. Keep experimenting.

*Don't try to change your brain. Change your environment and systems to fit your brain.*
