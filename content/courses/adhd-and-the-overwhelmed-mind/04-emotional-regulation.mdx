## The Emotional Side of ADHD

ADHD isn't just about attention. Emotional dysregulation is a core feature—often the most impactful one.

Yet it's underrecognized. The diagnostic criteria focus on attention and hyperactivity. The emotional experience often goes unvalidated.

Understanding and working with ADHD emotions is essential for living well.

## ADHD and Emotions

### Emotional Dysregulation

Emotional dysregulation in ADHD involves:

**Intensity:** Emotions are bigger, stronger, more consuming.

**Reactivity:** Quick to react emotionally. Hair-trigger.

**Difficulty calming:** Once activated, harder to return to baseline.

**Low frustration tolerance:** Small obstacles trigger big reactions.

**Mood variability:** Rapid shifts, sometimes within hours.

This isn't personality. It's neurology. The prefrontal cortex—which regulates emotions—functions differently.

### Common Emotional Patterns

**Frustration and anger:**
- Quick to frustrate
- Irritability
- Outbursts followed by regret
- Difficulty tolerating obstacles

**Rejection sensitivity (RSD):**
- Intense pain from perceived rejection or criticism
- Out of proportion to the situation
- Can be debilitating
- Often leads to avoidance

**Emotional flooding:**
- Overwhelmed by feeling
- Can't think clearly
- Needs time to recover
- Everything feels like too much

**Anxiety:**
- Often co-occurs with ADHD
- Worry about forgetting, failing, disappointing
- Performance anxiety

**Low self-esteem:**
- Years of "not meeting potential"
- Accumulated shame and failure
- Negative self-image

### Not Separate from ADHD

These emotional patterns aren't separate problems—they're part of ADHD.

Understanding this helps:
- Reduce self-blame
- Target appropriate interventions
- See the full picture

## Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria

### What It Is

Rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is extreme emotional sensitivity to:
- Perceived rejection
- Criticism (even constructive)
- Falling short of expectations
- Disapproval from others or self

"Dysphoria" means difficult to bear—that's the key. This isn't normal sensitivity; it's an intense, often overwhelming reaction.

### The Experience

RSD can feel like:
- Physical pain at rejection
- Immediate, intense emotional crash
- Rage or profound hurt
- Shame spirals
- Catastrophic interpretation of neutral events

### Impact

RSD can lead to:
- People-pleasing to avoid rejection
- Avoiding trying to avoid failing
- Not expressing authentic self
- Rage at perceived criticism
- Depression from internalized criticism

### Working with RSD

**Recognize it:** Name it when it's happening. "This is RSD, not reality."

**Wait before responding:** Intense reactions pass. Don't act in the moment.

**Reality test:** Is this actually rejection? Check with trusted others.

**Self-compassion:** You didn't choose this sensitivity. Be gentle with yourself.

**Medication:** Some ADHD medications and certain other medications can help reduce RSD.

## Managing Emotional Intensity

### Prevention

Reduce emotional vulnerability:
- **Sleep:** Emotional regulation requires sleep
- **Food:** Blood sugar crashes worsen reactivity
- **Medication:** If applicable, take consistently
- **Stress management:** Chronic stress depletes regulation
- **Avoid depleting situations:** Know what drains you

### In the Moment

When emotions flood:

**Recognize what's happening:**
- "I'm flooded right now"
- "This is emotional dysregulation"
- "I need to pause"

**Remove yourself if possible:**
- "I need a minute"
- Step away from the situation
- Create space

**Physical grounding:**
- Cold water on face (triggers dive reflex)
- Breathing: slow, extended exhales
- Movement: walk, shake, discharge energy
- Grounding: feet on floor, notice surroundings

**Wait:**
- Don't make decisions while flooded
- Don't send that message
- Let the wave pass

**Return when regulated:**
- Address the issue from a calmer state
- Apologize if needed
- Don't pretend it didn't happen

### After the Flood

**Learn from it:**
- What triggered this?
- Were there warning signs?
- What helped or didn't?

**Repair if needed:**
- Apologize for behavior (not for having emotions)
- Reconnect with those affected

**Self-compassion:**
- This is hard
- You're dealing with a real challenge
- Don't add shame to the pile

## The Inner Critic

### ADHD and Self-Criticism

The ADHD inner critic is often brutal:
- Catalogues every failure
- Predicts future disasters
- Says "you'll never change"
- Uses shame as motivation (which doesn't work)

This develops from years of:
- Not meeting expectations
- Being told you're not trying
- Seeing others succeed at what you can't
- Internalizing external criticism

### Working with the Critic

**Notice it:**
- "There's my inner critic"
- Recognize the voice as a voice, not truth

**Don't engage:**
- Arguing with the critic strengthens it
- Simply notice and redirect

**Self-compassion:**
- "This is hard"
- "Many people struggle with this"
- "What would I say to a friend?"

**Question it:**
- Is this true, or is it shame talking?
- Is this helpful?
- Would I say this to someone I love?

**Replace with coaching:**
- "Okay, that didn't work. What can I try next?"
- Problem-solve, don't criticize

## Building Emotional Resilience

### Long-Term Work

Emotional regulation improves over time with:

**Therapy:**
- CBT for thought patterns
- DBT for emotional regulation skills
- Therapy for underlying issues

**Medication:**
- ADHD medication can help emotional regulation
- Some people need additional medication for emotional symptoms

**Practice:**
- Each time you regulate successfully, you build capacity
- The skills improve with use
- It does get easier

**Self-knowledge:**
- Know your triggers
- Know your patterns
- Prepare for difficult situations

### What Stays

Even with improvement, you'll likely always have:
- Bigger emotions than some people
- Need for more recovery time
- Sensitivity to certain things
- Occasional overwhelm

That's okay. Managing it, not eliminating it, is the goal.
