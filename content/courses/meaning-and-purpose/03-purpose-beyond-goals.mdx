## More Than Achievement

Goals are important. They give us direction and something to work toward. But purpose is bigger than any goal. It's the "why" behind the goals, the larger direction of your life.

Goals can be achieved and checked off. Purpose is ongoing. It gives meaning to the goals, and continues when goals are met.

---

## Goals vs. Purpose

### The Distinction

**Goals:**
- Specific and measurable
- Time-bound
- Achievable (you can complete them)
- The "what"

**Purpose:**
- Broad and directional
- Ongoing and open-ended
- Never "completed"
- The "why"

### Example

**Goal:** Write a book
**Purpose:** To contribute ideas that help people grow

**Goal:** Get a medical degree
**Purpose:** To heal and serve others

The goal serves the purpose. The purpose gives the goal meaning.

### The Problem with Goals Alone

When life is only goals:
- Each achievement is followed by "what now?"
- The hedonic treadmill continues
- Success feels empty
- There's no underlying meaning

Purpose provides context that gives goals significance.

## What Is Purpose?

### Definitions

Purpose typically involves:
- A sense of direction
- Feeling called to something
- Contributing to something larger than yourself
- Meaningful engagement with life

### Components

Purpose often includes:
- **Orientation:** A general direction (not a specific destination)
- **Contribution:** Something that serves beyond yourself
- **Commitment:** Ongoing dedication
- **Identity:** Connection to who you are

### Multiple Purposes

You may have:
- Different purposes in different domains (work, family, creative)
- Purposes that evolve over time
- Overlapping purposes that reinforce each other

Purpose isn't singular.

  id="pbg-clues"
  prompt="Look for clues to purpose:

• What activities make you lose track of time?
• What problems do you care about solving?
• What do people come to you for?
• What would you regret not doing?

## Finding Purpose

### Purpose Isn't Waiting

Purpose isn't:
- Hidden and waiting to be found
- A single destiny you might miss
- Something you discover in a flash

Purpose is:
- Constructed through engagement
- Multiple and evolving
- Clarified through living

### Questions That Help

To clarify purpose, ask:
- What would I do if I had enough money and didn't need to work?
- What breaks my heart in the world?
- What would I like to be remembered for?
- What am I willing to sacrifice for?
- What feels like a calling?

### Purpose Through Action

Often purpose emerges from:
- Doing things and noticing what matters
- Helping others and seeing the impact
- Following curiosity and commitment
- Contributing and feeling significance

Engage first. Clarity follows.

## Purpose and Work

### Work as Purpose Vehicle

For many, work relates to purpose:
- Meaningful work expresses purpose
- A career can serve larger contribution
- Work provides identity and direction

### When Work Isn't Purpose

But work doesn't have to be your purpose:
- Work can fund other purposes
- Purpose can be expressed outside of career
- Job ≠ calling for everyone

### Finding Purpose Outside Work

Purpose through:
- Family and relationships
- Creative expression
- Volunteer work and community
- Personal projects
- How you live, not just what you do

---

## Purpose and Contribution

### Larger Than Self

Most meaningful purposes involve:
- Serving something beyond yourself
- Making a difference to others
- Contributing to the world
- Connecting to something larger

### Contribution Types

Ways to contribute:
- Creating things of value
- Helping specific people
- Advancing a cause
- Raising and nurturing others
- Building community
- Preserving and transmitting knowledge

### The Size Doesn't Matter

Contribution doesn't require:
- Changing the world dramatically
- Fame or recognition
- Large-scale impact

Small, genuine contribution can be deeply purposeful.

## Living with Purpose

### Purpose as Ongoing

Purpose isn't a destination:
- It's a direction you walk
- Each day offers opportunities
- Small actions express purpose
- It unfolds through living

### Purpose-Aligned Choices

Living purposefully means:
- Choosing based on values and purpose
- Saying yes to what matters
- Saying no to distractions
- Prioritizing purpose

### The Days Add Up

Your life is made of days:
- Purpose is expressed daily
- Not just in big moments
- Mundane actions can serve purpose
- Consistency matters

---

## Key Concepts

- **Goals vs. purpose:** Goals are specific achievements; purpose is ongoing direction
- **What purpose is:** Direction, contribution, commitment, identity
- **Not waiting to be found:** Purpose is made through engagement
- **Purpose and work:** Can but doesn't have to be through career
- **Contribution:** Purpose usually involves serving beyond yourself
- **Living with purpose:** Expressed daily through choices and actions

<Callout type="important">
You don't need to have your purpose perfectly defined to live purposefully. A rough direction is enough. Engage with life, follow what matters, and clarity will emerge. Purpose is less about finding and more about living.
</Callout>

*Purpose isn't a treasure hidden somewhere. It's a direction you walk, every day.*
