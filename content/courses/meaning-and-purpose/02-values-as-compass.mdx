## Your Internal Compass

Values are what matter to you—your deepest sense of what's important, what you stand for, how you want to live. They're not goals to achieve but directions to move toward, continuously.

When you know your values and live in alignment with them, life feels meaningful. When you don't, it feels empty regardless of external success.

## Understanding Values

### What Values Are

Values are:
- Chosen life directions
- What matters to you at your core
- How you want to show up
- Qualities you want to embody
- What gives life meaning

### What Values Aren't

Values are not:
- Goals (goals are achievable; values are ongoing)
- Rules imposed by others
- What you "should" care about
- Fixed or permanent
- Achievements or outcomes

### Values vs. Goals

**Goal:** Get promoted to manager
**Value:** Excellence, leadership, making a contribution

**Goal:** Run a marathon
**Value:** Health, discipline, challenging myself

Goals are destinations. Values are directions.

## Values and Daily Life

### The Gap

For many people:
- They know what they value
- But daily life doesn't reflect it
- There's a gap between values and actions
- This gap creates emptiness

### Values in Action

Living your values means:
- Choices that align with what matters
- Daily actions that express values
- Priorities that reflect values
- Time spent on what matters

### Small Acts

Values don't require grand gestures:
- If you value health, a daily walk counts
- If you value connection, a phone call matters
- If you value learning, reading a chapter counts
- If you value contribution, small kindnesses count

Values are lived in ordinary moments.

## Conflicting Values

### Values Can Conflict

Sometimes values clash:
- Career success vs. family time
- Adventure vs. security
- Independence vs. connection
- Authenticity vs. harmony

### Navigating Conflicts

When values conflict:
- Acknowledge the tension
- Prioritize based on context and life stage
- Accept trade-offs
- Revisit the balance

There's no perfect resolution. Life is trade-offs.

### Values Clarification

Conflicts reveal what matters most:
- What would you sacrifice for what?
- Which value is deeper?
- What do you regret neglecting?

Conflicts can clarify priorities.

---

## Values Over Time

### Values Evolve

Your values change as you:
- Have new experiences
- Enter different life stages
- Grow and mature
- Learn from living

The values of your 20s may differ from your 50s.

### Revisiting Values

Periodically:
- Check in with your values
- See if they still fit
- Notice what's changed
- Update your understanding

Values aren't fixed forever.

---

## Key Concepts

- **What values are:** Chosen life directions, not goals
- **Why they matter:** Guidance, meaning, motivation
- **Discovery:** Through reflection on what matters most
- **Values in action:** Daily choices that express what you value
- **Conflicts:** Values sometimes clash; trade-offs are inevitable

<Callout type="important">
Your values are yours. They don't need to match anyone else's, and they don't need external validation. What matters is that they're genuinely yours—not inherited without examination or adopted to please others. Living by someone else's values is a recipe for emptiness.
</Callout>

*When you know what matters, you know how to live. Values are the compass.*
