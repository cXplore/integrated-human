## The Lost Knowing

You were born with a deep, embodied knowing—an intuition that told you what was true, what was safe, what was right for you.

Then you were taught to doubt it.

- "You're being too sensitive"
- "That didn't really happen"
- "You're overreacting"
- "Trust the experts"
- "Don't be silly"
- "You don't know what you want"

Over time, you learned to distrust your knowing and defer to external authority.

**Your intuition didn't disappear. It just got buried.**

## What Is Intuition?

Intuition is knowing without rational analysis. It includes:

### Gut Feelings:
- "Something feels off"
- Immediate sense about people or situations
- Knowing before you can explain

### Body Wisdom:
- What your body knows
- Physical signals and sensations
- The "yes" and "no" in your body

### Deep Knowing:
- Truth that comes from beyond thinking
- Clarity that arrives suddenly
- Understanding without evidence

### Pattern Recognition:
- Unconscious processing of information
- Reading between the lines
- Sensing what's not being said

---

## How Intuition Gets Suppressed

### Gaslighting:
- Being told your perceptions are wrong
- Having your reality denied
- Learning not to trust what you know

### Dismissal:
- "You're being irrational"
- "That's just feelings, not facts"
- "You can't know that"

### Override:
- Taught to follow rules over instinct
- External authorities know better
- Logic trumps feeling

### Trauma:
- Dissociation from body
- Hypervigilance distorting signals
- Threat responses overwhelming knowing

### Patriarchy:
- Male logic valued over female intuition
- "Women are irrational"
- Knowledge requires proof

## Reconnecting with Body Wisdom

Your body is constantly giving you information. Reconnection starts with attention.

### The Body Knows:
- **Yes:** Expansion, opening, energy, warmth, ease
- **No:** Contraction, closing, heaviness, unease, tension
- **Danger:** Alarm, racing heart, churning stomach
- **Truth:** Settling, clarity, "rightness"
- **Deception:** Something "off," unease, don't want to look

### Practice: Check In
Before decisions, situations, or interactions:
1. Pause
2. Notice your body
3. What's the sensation?
4. What is it telling you?

<Exercise title="Body Wisdom Practice">

<Journal
  id="body-yes-no"
  prompt="Think of a recent decision or situation. What did your body say? Describe the physical sensations. Was it a yes, a no, or something else?"
  placeholder="The situation:&#10;&#10;Physical sensations:&#10;&#10;My body was saying..."
  rows={6}

<Journal
  id="body-practice"
  prompt="This week, practice checking in with your body before decisions. What do you notice when you ask your body rather than just your mind?"
  placeholder="When I check in with my body, I notice...&#10;&#10;My body often says...&#10;&#10;This is different from my mind, which..."

## The Difference: Intuition vs. Fear

This is a common confusion. How do you know if it's intuition or just anxiety?

### Intuition:
- Quiet and clear
- Arrives suddenly, then settles
- Doesn't argue or justify
- Feels like truth
- Often body-centered

### Fear/Anxiety:
- Loud and spinning
- Persistent rumination
- Argumentative, "what if"
- Feels urgent and pressured
- Often mind-centered

### Key Question:
Does this feel like a clear signal or a panicked spiral?

**Intuition informs. Anxiety alarms.**

## Developing Intuitive Muscle

Like any capacity, intuition strengthens with use.

### Practices:
1. **Ask your body:** Before you decide with your mind, ask your body
2. **Honor small signals:** Practice with low-stakes decisions
3. **Track your hits:** Notice when intuition was right
4. **Reduce noise:** Quiet external input sometimes
5. **Spend time in nature:** Natural environments support intuition
6. **Journal:** Write without thinking, see what comes
7. **Dreams:** Pay attention to dream wisdom

## Trusting Your Knowing About People

One area where intuition is essential: reading people.

### Your Body Knows:
- When someone isn't safe
- When someone is lying
- When someone has good intentions
- When something is off

### Why We Override:
- We want to be liked
- We don't want to be rude
- We question ourselves
- We give benefit of the doubt
- We've been taught to be nice

**Your safety matters more than their comfort.**

<Exercise title="Reading People">

<Journal
  id="people-intuition"
  prompt="Think of a time you had a feeling about someone that you ignored. What was the feeling? What happened? What did you learn?"
  placeholder="I had a feeling about someone...&#10;&#10;I ignored it because...&#10;&#10;What happened:&#10;&#10;What I learned:"
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## The "Knowing" You've Been Suppressing

Sometimes intuition carries information you don't want to know:

- This relationship isn't working
- This job is wrong for you
- You need to make a change
- Someone isn't who they seem
- You're not living your real life

**Intuition doesn't only tell you comfortable things.**

---

<Exercise title="Uncomfortable Knowing">

<Journal
  id="suppressed-knowing"
  prompt="Is there something you know but don't want to know? Something your intuition has been telling you that you've been avoiding?"
  placeholder="What I've been avoiding knowing:&#10;&#10;My intuition has been saying...&#10;&#10;I've avoided this because..."
  rows={8}
/>

## Rebuilding Self-Trust

Self-trust was likely damaged through years of override. Rebuilding takes time.

### Start Small:
- Trust yourself on little things
- Make decisions and stick with them
- Notice when you're right
- Stop asking everyone else's opinion

### Celebrate Hits:
- Keep track of when intuition was accurate
- This builds evidence for self-trust
- Your knowing is reliable

### Stop the Override:
- When you know, act on it
- Don't explain yourself
- Trust the body's response
- Stop second-guessing

---

<Exercise title="Rebuilding Trust">

<Journal
  id="self-trust-blocks"
  prompt="What makes it hard to trust yourself? What voices tell you not to trust your knowing?"
  placeholder="I struggle to trust myself because...&#10;&#10;Voices that undermine my self-trust:&#10;&#10;Where these voices came from:"
  rows={6}
/>

<Journal
  id="self-trust-building"
  prompt="What would help you rebuild self-trust? What's one way you could practice trusting yourself this week?"
  placeholder="To rebuild self-trust, I could...&#10;&#10;One way I'll practice this week:&#10;&#10;I commit to..."
  rows={6}
/>
