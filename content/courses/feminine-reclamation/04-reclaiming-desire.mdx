## The Crime of Wanting

Women learn early that wanting—really wanting—is dangerous.

You were taught:
- Wanting is selfish
- Good women put others first
- Desire is shameful (especially sexual desire)
- Asking for things is needy
- Be satisfied with what you have
- Don't be greedy

So you learned to want less. Or to not know what you want at all.

**Reclaiming desire is reclaiming the right to want your own life.**

---

## What Is Desire?

Desire is the life force that moves toward what you want:

- Physical pleasure
- Creative expression
- Achievement and success
- Connection and love
- Sensual experience
- Material things
- Experiences and adventures
- Becoming who you want to be

**Desire is not shameful. It's how life moves through you.**

## How Desire Gets Suppressed

### Direct Messages:
- "Don't be selfish"
- "Who do you think you are?"
- "You should be grateful for what you have"
- "Nice girls don't want that"
- "That's not realistic"

### Indirect Messages:
- Seeing women punished for wanting
- Watching mother sacrifice her desires
- Being given less than brothers
- Desire leading to danger or shame
- Wanting something and not getting it (so stopping wanting)

### Results:
- Not knowing what you want
- Wanting what others want you to want
- Desire becoming obsessive or addictive
- Only allowing "acceptable" desires
- Shame around wanting

## "I Don't Know What I Want"

Many women genuinely don't know what they want because:

- They were never asked
- Their wants were always overridden
- Wanting was punished
- They learned to focus on others' wants
- Desire was disconnected

### This isn't fixed by thinking harder

Desire lives in the body. To reconnect with what you want, you have to feel into it, not figure it out.

---

## Reconnecting with Desire

### Practice 1: What Does Your Body Want?

Start with physical desires—they're most accessible:
- What does your body want right now?
- What sensations does it crave?
- What would feel good?

### Practice 2: Noticing Envy

Envy points to desire:
- What do you envy in others?
- What do you wish you had?
- When do you feel jealous?

**Envy isn't shameful—it's information about what you want.**

### Practice 3: If Nothing Were in the Way

- If money weren't an issue, what would you want?
- If no one would judge you, what would you want?
- If you couldn't fail, what would you want?
- If you deserved it, what would you want?

  placeholder="I envy people who...&#10;&#10;They have/do...&#10;&#10;This tells me I want..."
  rows={6}
/>

<Journal
  id="if-nothing-in-way"
  prompt="If nothing were in the way—no money issues, no judgment, no possibility of failure—what would you want?"
  placeholder="If nothing were in the way, I would want..."

## Sexual Desire

For many women, sexual desire is the most suppressed.

### Messages You May Have Received:
- Good girls don't want sex
- Your sexuality is for others' pleasure, not yours
- Being "too sexual" makes you worthless
- Men want sex, women tolerate it
- Your body is dangerous
- Virginity is your value

### The Result:
- Disconnection from sexual desire
- Shame around wanting
- Performing sex rather than wanting it
- Not knowing what you like
- Desire only through partner's desire

<Exercise title="Sexual Desire Reflection">

<Journal
  id="sexual-messages"
  prompt="What messages did you receive about female sexuality? How have they affected your relationship with your own desire?"
  placeholder="I was taught that female sexuality was...&#10;&#10;This affected me by...&#10;&#10;My relationship with my own sexual desire is..."
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="sexual-desire-now"
  prompt="How connected are you to your own sexual desire—desire that's for you, not for anyone else? What would support reclaiming this?"
  placeholder="My connection to my own desire is...&#10;&#10;What would support reclaiming this..."

## The Right to Want

You have the right to:
- Want things for yourself
- Pursue your own pleasure
- Have ambitious desires
- Want material abundance
- Want sexual satisfaction
- Want rest and ease
- Want success and recognition
- Want your own life

**These aren't selfish. They're human.**

---

## Desire and Guilt

When you start wanting again, guilt often arises.

### The Guilt Says:
- "You're being selfish"
- "Who do you think you are?"
- "You don't deserve this"
- "Others need more than you"
- "This isn't who you're supposed to be"

### The Truth:
- Wanting doesn't take from others
- Your desires matter as much as anyone's
- Guilt is old conditioning, not truth
- Full people give more than empty ones
- You deserve to want

---

<Exercise title="Working with Guilt">

<Journal
  id="desire-guilt"
  prompt="When you let yourself want, what guilt arises? Whose voice is this guilt? What did they teach you about wanting?"
  placeholder="When I want, I feel guilty because...&#10;&#10;This guilt sounds like...&#10;&#10;It comes from..."
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="guilt-response"
  prompt="What would you say to this guilt? How would you respond from the part of you that knows you deserve to want?"
  placeholder="I would say to this guilt..."
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

## Asking for What You Want

Desire leads to asking. Many women struggle to ask directly.

### Common Patterns:
- Hinting instead of asking
- Hoping others will guess
- Taking whatever is offered
- Making yourself easy/low-maintenance
- Feeling like a burden for having needs

### Direct Asking:
- "I would like..."
- "I want..."
- "What would work for me is..."
- "I need..."

**Asking doesn't guarantee getting. But not asking guarantees not getting.**

<Exercise title="Practicing Asking">

<Journal
  id="want-to-ask"
  prompt="What do you want to ask for but haven't? From whom? What stops you?"
  placeholder="I want to ask for...&#10;&#10;From:&#10;&#10;What stops me is..."
  rows={6}
/>

<Journal
  id="practice-ask"
  prompt="Write out exactly what you would say if you asked directly. Practice the words."
  placeholder="If I asked directly, I would say:&#10;&#10;'I want...'&#10;'I need...'&#10;'Would you...'"
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

## Living from Desire

What would life look like if you let desire guide you?

### Questions:
- What would you pursue?
- What would you stop doing?
- How would you spend your time?
- What would your body experience?
- What would your relationships look like?
- What would you create?

<Exercise title="Desire-Led Life">

<Journal
  id="desire-led"
  prompt="If you let your desires guide your life—not in a reckless way, but as compass—what would change? What would you move toward?"
  placeholder="If I let desire guide me, I would...&#10;&#10;I would move toward...&#10;&#10;I would stop...&#10;&#10;My life would look like..."
  rows={10}
/>

## Key Concepts

- **Suppressed Desire:** Women learn that wanting is selfish, shameful, or dangerous.

- **Disconnection:** Many women don't know what they want because desire was cut off.

- **Body-Based Desire:** Desire lives in the body, not the mind. Reconnection happens through feeling.

- **Sexual Desire:** Often the most suppressed area, requiring specific reclamation.

- **Direct Asking:** Moving from hints and hopes to clear, direct requests.

## What's Next

In Module 5, you'll work with mother wounds—what your mother couldn't give or gave too much. The mother relationship is central to feminine development and often requires specific healing.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice noticing what your body wants throughout the day
- Identify one desire you've been suppressing
- Practice asking for something directly

---

*Your desire is not a problem to solve. It's a compass pointing toward your life.*
