## Working with Archetypes

Archetypes are universal patterns of feminine energy that exist across cultures and throughout history. They're not rigid categories—they're doorways into aspects of yourself.

Every woman has access to all archetypes. The question is which ones are:
- **Overdeveloped:** You rely on them too heavily
- **Underdeveloped:** You have little access to them
- **In shadow:** They express in distorted ways

**Understanding archetypes helps you develop a more complete feminine self.**

## Archetypes and Life Stages

Different archetypes may dominate at different life stages:

### Maiden Phase:
Youth, exploration, possibility, before major responsibilities

### Mother Phase:
Creating, nurturing—whether children, projects, or people

### Queen Phase:
Coming into full authority and power

### Sage/Crone Phase:
Wisdom, mentoring, seeing the bigger picture

**But all archetypes are available at any age.** A young woman can access the Sage. An older woman can reclaim the Maiden.

## The Full Circle

Wholeness isn't about being all archetypes equally all the time. It's about:

- **Having access** to each archetype when needed
- **Knowing** which to draw on in different situations
- **Not being stuck** in only one or two
- **Bringing shadow** into conscious expression

The Maiden brings lightness when things get heavy.
The Queen sets boundaries when you're being walked over.
The Huntress pursues when you're being passive.
The Lover reconnects when you're cut off from desire.

**Each archetype is a resource you can call on.**

## Your Primary Archetype

Many women have a "home base" archetype—the one that feels most natural.

This is a gift AND a limitation:
- **Gift:** You have deep access to this energy
- **Limitation:** You may over-rely on it

For example:
- Strong Mother archetype: Great at nurturing, but may neglect own needs (needs Queen)
- Strong Huntress: Great at independence, but may struggle with vulnerability (needs Lover)
- Strong Mystic: Great intuition, but may be ungrounded (needs Huntress)

## Key Concepts

- **Archetypes:** Universal patterns of feminine energy that exist across cultures.

- **The Seven:** Maiden, Mother, Queen, Huntress, Sage, Mystic, Lover.

- **Overdeveloped/Underdeveloped:** Which archetypes you have more or less access to.

- **Shadow Expression:** When an archetype expresses in distorted, unconscious ways.

- **Home Base:** Your natural dominant archetype, which is both gift and limitation.

---

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll focus specifically on reclaiming your anger—the rage you weren't allowed to feel. This is often the first and most important reclamation for women.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify your strongest and weakest archetypes
- Notice one archetype you want to develop
- Consider how your home base has both helped and limited you

---

*You contain all of these. The work is making them conscious and available.*
