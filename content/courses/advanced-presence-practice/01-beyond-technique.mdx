## The Journey of Practice

Most practitioners follow a similar arc:

**Beginning:**
- Learning techniques
- Struggling with consistency
- Fighting the wandering mind
- Technique feels effortful

**Middle:**
- Techniques become familiar
- Some concentration develops
- Insights begin to arise
- Practice feels more natural

**Advancing:**
- Techniques become transparent
- Effort decreases
- Direct recognition emerges
- The boundary between practice and life softens

This course is for the advancing stage—when techniques have done their work and something simpler becomes possible.

---

## The Purpose of Technique

Techniques serve a function:

They train attention (concentration practices)
They create insight (investigation practices)
They settle the mind (calming practices)
They build capacity (discipline of regular practice)

These are valuable. Without them, most people can't access deeper presence.

But techniques are not the goal. They're scaffolding.

The technique points at the moon. When you can see the moon directly, you don't need to keep staring at the finger.

## Signs You're Ready

You might be ready to move beyond technique when:

- Techniques feel limiting, not freeing
- You sense there's something simpler
- The effort of practice feels counterproductive
- Spontaneous presence occurs outside formal practice
- You've built a solid foundation (years, not months)
- There's less struggle with the mind

These are invitations, not requirements. If technique still serves, keep using it.

## The Problem with Method

At a certain point, method becomes obstacle:

**Effort creates separation**
The one who's trying and the thing being achieved stay two. The trying itself prevents arrival.

**Seeking implies lack**
If you're seeking presence, you're assuming you're not already present. But presence is your nature.

**Technique is dualistic**
There's the doer, the doing, and the result. But non-dual awareness has no such divisions.

This doesn't mean technique is bad. It means there's something beyond it.

---

## What Comes Next

Beyond technique:
- **Resting in awareness itself** — Not cultivating anything, just being
- **Natural presence** — Not trying to be present, just noticing you already are
- **Effortless attention** — Attention without a director
- **Non-doing** — The practice of non-practice

These can't really be taught. They can only be pointed at. You recognize them yourself.

---

## The Transition

Moving from technique to no-technique isn't sudden.

Usually:
- Techniques become lighter
- Less effort is needed
- Periods of effortless presence lengthen
- The boundary between meditation and non-meditation blurs
- Eventually, formal practice is just resting in what's always here

This happens organically when the ground is prepared.

---

## A Warning

Moving "beyond technique" too soon is a common trap:

If you haven't built foundation, "no technique" becomes justification for no practice.
If the mind isn't somewhat trained, "resting in awareness" is just spacing out.
If insight hasn't developed, "non-dual" becomes a concept, not experience.

Be honest: Have you actually done the foundational work?

<Exercise title="Honest Assessment">

Honestly assess your readiness.

<Journal
  id="app-assess"
  prompt="Answer honestly:

DO YOU HAVE A REGULAR, ESTABLISHED PRACTICE?

CAN YOU MAINTAIN ATTENTION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS?

HAS INSIGHT ARISEN FROM DIRECT EXPERIENCE (not books)?

ARE YOU DRAWN BEYOND TECHNIQUE, OR LOOKING FOR EASIER PATH?

WHAT WOULD A TEACHER SAY ABOUT YOUR READINESS?"

## Both/And

The path forward is both/and:

Keep technique available (for when it helps)
AND explore what's beyond technique

Maintain practice structure
AND let spontaneous presence inform

Honor the journey
AND recognize you've always been here

---

## Key Ideas

- Techniques are scaffolding, not the building
- At advanced stages, method can become obstacle
- Signs of readiness: techniques feel limiting, spontaneous presence arises
- Beyond technique: resting in awareness, natural presence, effortless attention
- Warning: don't skip foundational work
- Both/and: keep technique available while exploring beyond

*The techniques brought you here. Now: what's here without them?*
