## What Is Non-Dual?

"Non-dual" means not-two.

Ordinarily, experience seems divided:
- Me / world
- Subject / object
- Inside / outside
- Knower / known

Non-dual glimpses are moments when this division collapses. There's just... experience happening. No separate self looking at it.

---

## The Illusion of Separation

Normally, it feels like:

There's "me" in here → looking at the world out there

This creates a fundamental split. Me vs. everything else.

But look closely: where exactly is the boundary?

Where does "me" end and "world" begin?
Where does "inside" stop and "outside" start?

The boundary gets fuzzy under investigation.

<Callout type="important">
The sense of being a separate self is powerful and convincing. But it's constructed. In moments of non-dual recognition, the construction is seen through—not as theory, but as direct experience.

## What Glimpses Feel Like

Non-dual glimpses vary, but often include:

- **Spaciousness** — The sense of being a small self expands
- **Peace** — The struggle to be something stops
- **Immediacy** — Experience is vivid, direct, unmediated
- **Unity** — The sense of separation falls away
- **Naturalness** — Nothing exotic, just "of course"
- **No one doing** — Things happen, but there's no doer
- **Wonder** — "How did I miss this?"

These aren't hallucinations. They're more like seeing clearly what was always there.

## How They Arise

Glimpses can arise:

**In formal practice**
Deep meditation sometimes opens into non-dual recognition.

**Spontaneously**
In nature, in flow, in moments of great beauty or crisis.

**Through pointing-out instructions**
A teacher points, and suddenly you see.

**Through investigation**
Careful examination of the sense of self reveals its constructed nature.

You can't force a glimpse. But you can create conditions.

## The Subject That Can't Be Found

Here's a classic investigation:

Try to find the one who's looking.

You see objects (things in awareness).
There's obviously seeing happening.
But can you find the seer?

Look for it directly. Where is the subject?

Usually, this investigation reveals: there's no findable self behind experience. Just experience, appearing to no one in particular.

## Glimpses and Integration

A common pattern:

1. **Glimpse** — The recognition happens
2. **Forgetting** — Ordinary dualistic experience returns
3. **Remembering** — Recognition happens again
4. **Stabilization** — Recognition becomes more frequent, more stable
5. **Integration** — Daily life becomes suffused with recognition

Glimpses are beginnings, not endings. The work is integration.

<Exercise title="Glimpse Practice">

A practice for inviting glimpses.

<Journal
  id="app-glimpsepractice"
  prompt="Try this:

Sit quietly. Let thoughts settle.

Now: Can you find the one who's meditating?
Where is the meditator?
Look directly.

What do you find?

(Don't think about it—look for it)"

## Common Misunderstandings

**"I had a glimpse, now I'm enlightened"**
Glimpses are not endpoints. Integration takes time, sometimes years.

**"Non-dual means nothing matters"**
Actually, everything matters—just not from the anxious place of protecting a separate self.

**"I need to get rid of the ego"**
The ego is a useful function. It doesn't need to be destroyed, just seen through.

**"This is special"**
Actually, it's completely ordinary. Just what's always been here, noticed clearly.

## Returning to Basics

After glimpses, practitioners often return to basics:

- Regular sitting practice continues
- Ethics remain important
- Daily life engagement continues
- Integration becomes the focus

The glimpse shows what's possible. The work is living from it.

## Key Ideas

- Non-dual means not-two: the subject/object division collapses
- Glimpses: spacious, peaceful, immediate, unified, natural
- They arise through practice, spontaneously, through pointing-out, investigation
- The subject can't be found when looked for directly
- Glimpses are beginnings; integration is the work
- Common misunderstandings: enlightenment, nothing matters, destroy ego, it's special
- After glimpses: return to basics, focus on integration

*The separation you've always assumed? It was never there. Look closely. See for yourself.*
