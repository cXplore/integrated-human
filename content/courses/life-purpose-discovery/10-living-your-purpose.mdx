## Purpose and Identity

### Becoming Your Purpose

Identity through purpose:

- Focuses on being, not just doing
- Doesn't depend on external success
- Is about living aligned, not arriving

### The Person You Become

Ultimately:
- The greatest outcome is who you become
- Through living purpose, character is forged
- The journey is the destination
- Becoming is the purpose

## Final Words

Purpose is not a luxury. It's essential to a life well-lived. Without it, even success feels empty. With it, even struggle feels meaningful.

You've done the work of discovery. You've explored your history, clarified your values, identified your strengths, discovered what calls you, envisioned your contribution, faced your obstacles, and created your path.

Now comes the living.

Purpose isn't lived in grand moments but in daily choices. It's expressed not once but continuously. It evolves as you grow. It deepens as you live it.

Start now. Start small. Start where you are. But start.

Your purpose is waiting to be lived.

---

<Callout type="important">
You now know your purpose—at least enough to begin. The rest will clarify through living. Don't wait for perfect clarity. Don't postpone for better timing. Start now, with what you know, where you are. Purpose isn't found in thinking—it's found in living. Go live yours.
</Callout>

*The purpose of life is a life of purpose. Begin.*
