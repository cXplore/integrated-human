## The Human Need for Meaning

The question "What am I here for?" is one of the most fundamental human questions. Throughout history and across cultures, humans have sought meaning and purpose. This isn't luxury—it's necessity. This course guides you through the process of discovering your own life purpose.

## Why Purpose Matters

### The Research

Purpose is not just philosophical—it's practical:
- People with strong sense of purpose live longer
- Purpose correlates with better mental and physical health
- It protects against depression and anxiety
- It provides resilience during difficulty
- It increases life satisfaction

### The Experience

Without purpose, life often feels:
- Empty despite external success
- Directionless and drifting
- Lacking in deep satisfaction
- Like going through the motions
- Missing something essential

### With Purpose

With purpose, life tends to feel:
- Meaningful even during difficulty
- Directed toward something that matters
- Deeply satisfying at a core level
- Coherent and integrated
- Worth living fully

## Common Misconceptions

### "I Need to Find The One Thing"

The misconception:

The reality:

- There isn't just one right answer

### "Purpose Is About Career"

The misconception:

The reality:
- Purpose can be lived in any work
- It extends beyond career
- Roles like parent, friend, community member can be purposeful
- Work can express purpose but isn't identical to it

### "Some People Have Purpose, Some Don't"

The misconception:
- Purpose is a special gift some have
- You either have it or you don't
- Some people are just purpose-less

The reality:
- Everyone can develop sense of purpose
- It can be cultivated
- It's discovered through exploration
- No one is exempt from the possibility

<Callout type="important">
Purpose isn't a treasure buried somewhere waiting to be found. It's more like a garden that grows through cultivation. You discover it through exploration, clarify it through reflection, and live it through action. The journey of discovery is itself meaningful.

*The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.* — Ralph Waldo Emerson
