## The Power of Vision

### Why Vision Matters

Vision:

- Creates pull toward future
- Makes purpose tangible
- Guides decisions today

### Vision as Pull

Vision creates:
- Something to move toward
- Energy for the journey
- Clarity when confused
- Courage when afraid
- Persistence when tired

### Vision vs. Fantasy

Vision is not:
- Wishful thinking
- Escape from reality
- Guaranteed prediction
- Fixed destination

Vision is:
- Possibility you work toward
- Guiding image
- Inspiration for action
- Flexible direction

## The Feeling of Purpose

### Beyond Circumstances

Vision isn't just external circumstances:
- It's how you want to feel
- The experience of living purposefully
- The quality of your days
- Your inner state

### The Desired Experience

How do you want to feel living your purpose?
- Fulfilled? Energized? Peaceful?
- Connected? Meaningful? Alive?
- Creative? Contributing? Growing?

### Working Backward

Sometimes the feeling reveals the path:
- What would create that feeling?
- What activities, roles, contributions?
- What circumstances support that experience?
- Let desired feeling guide vision

## Testing Your Vision

### Does It Fit?

Test your vision against:
- Your values (does it honor them?)
- Your strengths (does it use them?)
- Your passions (does it include them?)
- Your contribution desire (does it serve?)

### Does It Energize?

Good vision should:
- Create energy when you imagine it
- Feel right, not just logical
- Pull you forward
- Sustain motivation

### Is It Yours?

Check that your vision is:
- Not someone else's dream for you
- Not what you think you should want
- Authentically yours
- True to who you are

<Exercise title="Testing Your Vision">

Test your vision for fit.

<Journal

## Holding Vision Lightly

### Vision as Guide, Not Prison

Vision should:
- Guide but not constrain
- Inspire but not obsess
- Direct but allow adjustment
- Be held but not grasped

### Allowing Evolution

Vision may:
- Clarify as you move forward
- Shift as you grow
- Include elements you can't yet see
- Surprise you

### Process, Not Destination

The purposeful life is:
- A way of living, not a place to arrive
- Ongoing expression, not final achievement
- Continuous unfolding
- Always in process

<Exercise title="Holding Vision Lightly">

Explore how to hold your vision.

<Journal

## Crystallizing Your Vision

### Bringing It Together

## Key Concepts

- **Power of vision:** Creates direction, motivation, and pull toward future

- **Vision elements:** Work, relationships, self—all integrated
- **Expanding possibility:** Moving beyond limiting beliefs
- **The feeling:** How you want to experience life, not just circumstances

---

<Callout type="important">
Vision makes purpose tangible. Without a picture of where you're going, purpose remains abstract. Take time to envision: the work, the relationships, the contribution, the person you become. Let vision pull you forward. Then hold it lightly enough to allow it to evolve as you grow.
</Callout>

*What you can envision, you can move toward. Envision well.*
