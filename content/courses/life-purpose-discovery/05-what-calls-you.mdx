## The Pull of Passion

Beyond values and strengths lies another dimension of purpose: what calls you. These are your passions—what draws you, energizes you, fascinates you. Purpose often lives where passion meets contribution. This module explores what you're called toward.

---

## What Passion Is

### Definition

Passion is:
- What you're naturally drawn to
- What energizes rather than drains
- What you'd pursue without external reward
- What you can't stop thinking about
- What makes you come alive

### Passion as Energy

Passion provides:
- Fuel for sustained effort
- Motivation through difficulty
- Energy that doesn't deplete
- Enthusiasm that's contagious
- Persistence without force

### Not Just Enjoyment

Passion is deeper than:
- Mere entertainment
- Pleasant activities
- Things you like
- Hobbies (though it can show up there)

Passion has weight and pull.

## Recognizing Calling

### How Calling Feels

Calling often feels like:
- Pull rather than push
- Energy rather than obligation
- Rightness, like you should be doing this
- Something you can't not do
- Deep satisfaction when engaged

### Signs You're Ignoring a Calling

When you ignore calling:
- Persistent restlessness
- Sense something is missing
- Envy of those doing what you want
- Recurring thoughts about "what if"
- Life feeling flat despite external success

### Distinguishing Calling from Should

Calling vs. should:
- Calling: Internal pull toward
- Should: External pressure to
- Calling: Energizes you
- Should: Obligates you
- Calling: You can't stop thinking about it
- Should: You feel guilty about not doing it

---

<Exercise title="Recognizing Your Calling">

Identify what might be calling you.

<Journal
  id="wcy-recognize"
  prompt="Recognize what calls you:

• What keeps pulling you, even when you resist?
• What can't you stop thinking about?
• What do you envy in others' lives or work?
• What have you always wanted to do but haven't?
• What feels like something you're supposed to be doing?
• What would you regret not pursuing?"

## Passion Discovery

### Where to Look

Look for passion in:
- What you do in free time
- What you talk about enthusiastically
- What you read, watch, explore
- What you lose yourself in
- What you'd do with unlimited time/money

### The "What Would You Do For Free?" Test

If money weren't a factor:
- What would you do with your days?
- What would you pursue?
- What problems would you work on?
- How would you contribute?

### Following Energy

Notice your energy:
- What activities increase energy?
- What topics spark you?
- What leaves you more alive?
- Where does enthusiasm naturally appear?

---

<Exercise title="Passion Discovery">

Discover your passions.

<Journal
  id="wcy-discover"
  prompt="Discover your passions:

• What do you do in your free time by choice?
• What do you talk about with enthusiasm?
• What do you naturally read, watch, or explore?
• If money weren't a factor, what would you do?
• What increases your energy?
• What makes you come alive?"
  placeholder="Free time choices:

</Exercise>

## Following the Thread

### The Thread You've Been Pulling

There's often a thread:
- Something you've been following your whole life
- A consistent pull through different chapters
- A theme that keeps appearing
- Something you keep coming back to

### Trusting the Pull

Following calling requires:
- Trusting what draws you
- Not dismissing it as impractical
- Taking it seriously as information
- Following even without full clarity

### Taking the Next Step

You don't need full clarity:
- Follow the pull one step at a time
- See where it leads
- Adjust as you go
- Let clarity emerge through engagement

---

<Exercise title="Following Your Thread">

Identify and follow your thread.

<Journal
  id="wcy-thread"
  prompt="Follow your thread:

• What thread have you been pulling your whole life?
• What keeps reappearing despite changes?
• What's the persistent pull?
• How have you dismissed or ignored this pull?
• What would it look like to follow it seriously?
• What's one next step to explore this calling?"
  placeholder="Thread I've been pulling:

What keeps reappearing:

Persistent pull:

How I've dismissed it:

Following it seriously:

## Obstacles to Following

### Why We Resist

Common resistances to calling:
- "It's not practical"
- "I can't make money doing that"
- "I'm too old/young/unprepared"
- "Who am I to pursue this?"
- "It's selfish to follow my passion"
- "I should be more responsible"

### The Cost of Not Following

Not following calling costs:
- Chronic dissatisfaction
- Wondering "what if"
- Energy lost to wrong pursuits
- Gifts unexpressed
- Life unlived

### Addressing Resistance

Work with resistance:
- Identify the specific fear
- Question the assumption
- Find ways to address legitimate concerns
- Start small to reduce risk
- Remember the cost of not following

---

<Exercise title="Addressing Resistance">

Address what blocks you from following.

<Journal
  id="wcy-resistance"
  prompt="Address your resistance:

• What stops you from following what calls you?
• What fears or objections arise?
• Are these fears valid? What's true about them?
• How could you address legitimate concerns?
• What's the cost of continuing to resist?
• What small step could you take despite resistance?"

## Passion and Purpose

### Where They Connect

Passion informs purpose:
- Passion provides energy
- Purpose provides direction
- Passion without purpose can be indulgent
- Purpose without passion is unsustainable

### Integration

Integrate passion into purpose:
- What you love + What you're good at + What the world needs
- Passion as fuel for contribution
- Calling as direction for strengths
- All elements working together

### When Passion Isn't Obvious

If passion isn't clear:
- Experiment with different activities
- Notice what sparks energy
- Follow curiosity wherever it leads
- Let passion emerge through exploration
- It may take time

---

<Exercise title="Passion and Purpose Integration">

Integrate passion into purpose.

<Journal
  id="wcy-integrate"
  prompt="Integrate passion into purpose:

• How might your passions point toward purpose?
• What would purpose look like fueled by your passion?
• How could you combine what you love with contribution?
• What's emerging about your calling?
• What purpose would you pursue passionately?"

## Listening for Calling

### Ongoing Listening

Calling isn't heard once and done:
- It requires ongoing listening
- It may clarify over time
- It may shift with life stages
- It speaks quietly and must be attended to

### Creating Space to Hear

To hear calling:
- Quiet the noise
- Make space for reflection
- Pay attention to inner movements
- Notice what persists
- Take signals seriously

### Trusting the Process

Trust that:
- Calling will become clearer
- Following leads to more clarity
- You don't need full understanding to start
- The way reveals itself through walking

---

<Exercise title="Listening for Your Calling">

Create practice of listening.

<Journal
  id="wcy-listen"
  prompt="Develop your listening practice:

• What helps you hear what calls you?
• What quiets the noise?
• What practices support your listening?
• What's calling you right now?
• What will you do to continue listening?"
  placeholder="What helps me hear:

What quiets noise:

Practices that support:

What's calling now:

---

<Callout type="important">
Calling isn't a luxury—it's information about what you're here to do. The pull you feel toward certain activities, topics, or causes isn't random. It's direction. Don't dismiss what calls you. Follow it, explore it, let it inform your purpose. What you love is a clue to what you're meant to contribute.
</Callout>

*What calls you is calling for a reason. Listen.*
