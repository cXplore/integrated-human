## The Foundation of Purpose

Purpose without values is direction without meaning. Your core values are what matter most to you—what you're willing to sacrifice for, what you can't compromise on, what makes life worth living. This module helps you clarify your core values as the foundation of your purpose.

---

## What Values Are

### Definition

Values are:
- What you care about most deeply
- What matters to you fundamentally
- What you won't compromise
- What guides your choices
- What you stand for

### Not the Same As

Values are different from:
- **Goals:** Things you want to achieve (values are how you want to live)
- **Interests:** Things you enjoy (values are deeper than enjoyment)
- **Beliefs:** Things you think are true (values are what you care about)
- **Preferences:** Things you prefer (values are non-negotiable)

### Why They Matter for Purpose

Values connect to purpose because:
- Purpose that violates values won't feel meaningful
- Values point toward what matters to you
- Living aligned with values is satisfying
- Values conflicts cause suffering
- Purpose expressed through values feels authentic

## Discovering Your Values

### Multiple Paths to Values

Values can be discovered through:
- Looking at peak experiences (what values were honored?)
- Looking at low points (what values were violated?)
- Looking at conflicts (what were you fighting for?)
- Looking at admiration (what values do you admire in others?)
- Looking at decisions (what values guided your choices?)

### Peak Experience Values

When you were at your best:
- What values were you living?
- What mattered in that moment?
- What made it meaningful?
- What was being honored?

### Violation and Anger

When you were most upset:
- What value was being violated?
- What made you angry or hurt?
- What felt threatened?
- What couldn't you accept?

## Understanding Your Values

### What Each Value Means to You

Values are words, but what do they mean to you specifically?

For each core value:
- What does this value mean to you?
- How do you know when it's being honored?
- How do you know when it's being violated?
- What does living this value look like?
- Why does this value matter to you?

### Your Unique Definition

Two people can share a value but mean different things:
- "Freedom" might mean travel to one, self-employment to another
- "Family" might mean closeness to one, loyalty to another
- "Success" might mean achievement to one, impact to another

Define your values in your terms.

<Exercise title="Defining Your Values">

Define your core values.

<Journal
  id="ycv-define"
  prompt="For each of your top 3-5 values, define what it means:

• What does living it look like?
• Why does it matter?

## Values and Current Life

### Alignment Assessment

How aligned is your current life with your values?

For each value:
- How fully are you living this value now?
- Where is it honored?
- Where is it violated or neglected?
- What would greater alignment look like?

### Where Values Are Violated

Identify misalignment:
- What areas of life violate your values?
- Where do you compromise what matters?
- What causes the most values conflict?
- What needs to change?

### The Cost of Misalignment

Living against your values:
- Creates chronic dissatisfaction
- Leads to burnout and depression
- Feels meaningless even with external success
- Erodes self-trust
- Blocks purpose fulfillment

---

<Exercise title="Values Alignment Audit">

Audit your current values alignment.

<Journal
  id="ycv-audit"
  prompt="Audit your values alignment:

For each core value, rate alignment (1-10):

VALUE 1: ___ /10
Where aligned:
Where misaligned:

VALUE 2: ___ /10
Where aligned:
Where misaligned:

VALUE 3: ___ /10
Where aligned:
Where misaligned:

## Values Conflicts

### When Values Clash

Sometimes values conflict:
- Family vs. Career (time allocation)
- Security vs. Adventure (risk tolerance)
- Authenticity vs. Harmony (truth vs. peace)
- Service vs. Self-care (giving vs. receiving)

### Managing Conflicts

When values conflict:
- Recognize the conflict explicitly
- Determine which value takes priority in this context
- Find creative solutions that honor both
- Accept tradeoffs consciously
- Know your non-negotiables

### Hierarchy of Values

Having a rough hierarchy helps:
- Which values trump others?
- What won't you sacrifice?
- What can be partially fulfilled?
- What's situationally flexible?

---

<Exercise title="Values Conflicts">

Explore your values conflicts.

<Journal
  id="ycv-conflicts"
  prompt="Explore values conflicts:

• What values conflicts do you experience?
• When do your values clash with each other?
• How have you resolved these in the past?
• Which value tends to win in conflicts?
• What's your values hierarchy—which values trump others?
• What would you never sacrifice?"

## Values and Purpose

### Values as Purpose Foundation

Your values inform purpose:
- Purpose should express values
- Values provide the "why" behind purpose
- A purpose that violates values will feel wrong
- Values-aligned purpose feels deeply right

### Connecting Them

Questions to connect values to purpose:
- How might your purpose express your core values?
- What activities or roles would let you live your values?
- What contribution would honor your values?
- What kind of work or life would be values-aligned?

### Values as Compass

Values serve as compass:
- When deciding direction, check against values
- When opportunities arise, filter through values
- When conflicted, return to values
- When lost, values point the way

---

<Exercise title="Values and Purpose Connection">

Connect values to purpose.

<Journal
  id="ycv-purpose"
  prompt="Connect your values to purpose:

• How might your purpose express your core values?
• What would a purpose look like that fully honors your values?
• What activities or roles let you live your values?
• What contribution would align with your values?
• How do your values point toward purpose?"
  placeholder="Purpose expressing values:

Activities/roles that honor values:

  rows={18}

## Committing to Your Values

### Living Your Values

Values clarification is meaningless without values living:
- Know your values (done)
- Define your values (done)
- Commit to your values (next)
- Live your values (ongoing)

### What Commitment Looks Like

Committing to values means:
- Making decisions based on values
- Saying no when values are threatened
- Designing life around values
- Accepting costs of values-living
- Not abandoning values under pressure

### Your Values Statement

Create a personal values statement:
- A declaration of what you stand for
- A reminder when you lose your way
- A filter for decisions
- An anchor for identity

---

<Exercise title="Your Values Commitment">

Commit to your values.

<Journal
  id="ycv-commit"
  prompt="Make your values commitment:

MY CORE VALUES ARE:
(List your top 3-5 values)

WHAT I WILL DO:
(How you'll live each value)

WHAT I WILL NOT DO:
(What you won't compromise)

MY VALUES STATEMENT:
Write a statement of what you stand for and how you'll live."
  placeholder="MY CORE VALUES:

WHAT I WILL DO:

WHAT I WILL NOT DO:

MY VALUES STATEMENT:..."
  rows={22}
/>

</Exercise>

## Key Concepts

- **Values defined:** What matters most, what you won't compromise, what you stand for
- **Values discovery:** Through peaks, lows, conflicts, admiration, decisions
- **Personal definition:** Values mean something specific to you
- **Alignment assessment:** Current life vs. values
- **Values conflicts:** When values clash, hierarchy helps
- **Values and purpose:** Purpose should express and honor values
- **Living values:** Commitment + daily choices = values-lived

---

<Callout type="important">
Purpose without values is direction without meaning. Your core values are the foundation of any meaningful purpose. They tell you what matters, guide your choices, and ensure your purpose actually fulfills you. Know them deeply. Live them fully. Build your purpose on this foundation.
</Callout>

*Values are not optional. They are the architecture of a life worth living.*
