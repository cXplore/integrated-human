## Purpose Beyond Self

Purpose isn't just self-discovery—it's world-engagement. True purpose involves contribution: using your gifts to address real needs. This module shifts focus outward, exploring what the world needs and how your unique capacities might serve.

---

## Why Contribution Matters

### Self-Focus Isn't Enough

Purpose purely about self:
- Eventually feels empty
- Doesn't satisfy deeper needs
- Can become narcissistic
- Misses the point

### The Research

Research shows:
- Contribution increases wellbeing more than self-focused goals
- Helping others provides lasting satisfaction
- Purpose tied to others is more meaningful
- Service paradoxically serves the self

### The Full Picture

Purpose integrates:
- What you love (passion)
- What you're good at (strengths)
- What you value (values)
- What the world needs (contribution)

All four create complete purpose.

## What the World Needs

### Seeing the Needs

The world has needs everywhere:
- Problems unsolved
- People suffering
- Systems broken
- Gaps unfilled
- Potential unrealized

### Categories of Need

Needs appear in many domains:
- **Personal:** Individuals needing help, healing, growth
- **Relational:** Connections needing repair, deepening
- **Community:** Local groups needing support, organization
- **Societal:** Larger systems needing reform, improvement
- **Environmental:** Planet needing protection, restoration

### Finding Your Intersection

Not all needs are yours to address:
- You can't solve everything
- Some needs match your gifts
- Some break your heart specifically
- Your contribution is specific, not universal

---

<Exercise title="Seeing Needs">

Explore the needs you see.

<Journal
  id="cas-needs"
  prompt="Explore needs that call you:

• What problems in the world bother you most?
• What suffering do you notice and care about?
• What's broken that you wish someone would fix?
• What needs match your awareness or experience?
• What could you uniquely contribute to?"
  placeholder="Problems that bother me:

## Your Unique Contribution

### What Only You Can Offer

Your contribution is unique because:
- Your specific combination of gifts
- Your particular experiences
- Your unique perspective
- What you've overcome
- How you see the world

### From Gifts to Service

Connect your gifts to service:
- How could your strengths address real needs?
- How could your passions serve others?
- How could your experiences help those on similar paths?
- What could you offer that few others can?

### Finding the Match

Look for where:
- Your strengths meet real needs
- Your passion addresses real problems
- Your experiences qualify you to help
- Your values align with impact

---

<Exercise title="Your Unique Contribution">

<Journal

## Who You're Here to Serve

### Identifying Your "Who"

You're not meant to serve everyone:
- Some people are your people
- Some problems are your problems
- Some domains are your domains
- Focus increases impact

### Finding Your People

Your people might be:
- Those who share your struggles
- Those in your community
- Those in your profession
- Those with shared values
- Those you naturally understand

### Connection Through Experience

Often you serve:
- Those on paths you've walked
- Those facing what you've faced
- Those seeking what you've found
- Those suffering what you've suffered

Your struggles become your qualification.

## Scale of Impact

### Different Scales

Contribution happens at different scales:

**One-to-One:**
- Serving individuals
- Deep personal impact
- Coaching, caring, helping

**One-to-Few:**
- Small groups
- Families, teams, circles
- Facilitation, teaching

**One-to-Many:**
- Larger audiences
- Writing, speaking, creating
- Scaled impact

**Systems Change:**
- Changing structures
- Policy, organizations, movements
- Leveraged impact

### What's Right for You?

Different scales suit different people:
- No scale is better
- Some people are wired for one-to-one
- Some for large-scale
- Your nature determines fit

### Depth vs. Breadth

The tradeoff:
- One-to-one: Deep impact on few
- One-to-many: Broader but shallower impact
- Choose based on what fulfills you
- Both are valuable

<Exercise title="Your Scale of Impact">

## Service and Self-Care

### Sustainable Service

Service must be sustainable:
- Burnout serves no one
- Depletion reduces impact
- Self-care enables service
- You must receive to give

### The Balance

Balance requires:
- Giving from overflow, not depletion
- Boundaries around service
- Rest and renewal
- Not martyrdom

### When Service Becomes Unhealthy

Warning signs:
- Resentment building
- Energy depleted
- Identity lost in serving
- Boundaries violated
- Giving at your own expense

---

<Exercise title="Sustainable Service">

Assess your service sustainability.

<Journal

- By [how/what you do]
- Using [your gifts/strengths]

<Callout type="important">
Purpose isn't complete until it extends beyond you. Your gifts exist not just for self-expression but for contribution. The world has real needs, and you have real gifts. Where they meet is purpose. Find what only you can give, and give it.
</Callout>

*You're not here just for yourself. What will you contribute?*
