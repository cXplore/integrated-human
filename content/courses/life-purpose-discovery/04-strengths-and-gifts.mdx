## Your Unique Contribution

Purpose isn't just about what you want—it's about what you can offer. Your strengths and gifts are what you bring to the table. They're your unique equipment for making a contribution. This module helps you discover and own what you're genuinely good at.

## Strengths vs. Skills

### The Difference

**Skills:**
- Learned abilities
- Can be developed by anyone
- May or may not energize you
- Competence through practice

**Strengths:**
- Natural capacities
- Come easier to you than others
- Energize you when used
- Excellence with less effort

### Why It Matters

For purpose:
- Skills tell you what you can do
- Strengths tell you what you're uniquely suited to do
- Purpose often lives at the intersection of strength and meaning
- Using strengths feels right and sustainable

### Both Matter

You need both:
- Strengths provide natural advantage
- Skills fill gaps
- Strengths without skills = wasted potential
- Skills without strengths = harder, less sustainable

## Identifying Your Strengths

### Signs of Strength

You're using a strength when:
- It feels natural, not forced
- Time passes quickly
- You're energized, not drained
- Others notice your ability
- You achieve results with less effort
- You enjoy the process

### Categories of Strength

Strengths appear in many forms:

**Thinking Strengths:**
Strategic thinking, analysis, creativity, learning, problem-solving, pattern recognition

**Relationship Strengths:**
Empathy, communication, persuasion, leadership, collaboration, conflict resolution

**Execution Strengths:**
Focus, discipline, organization, persistence, responsibility, reliability

**Influencing Strengths:**
Inspiring, activating, commanding, connecting, promoting

**Other Strengths:**
Artistic ability, physical capacity, intuition, humor, presence

### Your Pattern

Everyone has a unique pattern:
- Strong in some areas, not others
- Strength doesn't mean good at everything
- Your pattern is valuable as it is
- Purpose uses your actual strengths

## Feedback From Others

### External Perspective

Others see what you miss:
- Your strengths are so natural you don't notice them
- What's easy for you isn't easy for everyone
- Others experience your impact
- External feedback reveals blind spots

### Questions to Ask

Ask people who know you:
- What am I really good at?
- What do you come to me for?
- What do you see as my natural gifts?
- What do I do that seems effortless to me but hard for others?
- What do you value about how I am?

### Patterns Across Feedback

Look for:
- What multiple people say
- What surprises you
- What confirms what you suspected
- What you'd forgotten about yourself

---

<Exercise title="Gathering Feedback">

Gather and synthesize external feedback.

<Journal
  id="sag-feedback"

### Your Unique Combination

- A unique combination of abilities
- Strengths + experience + perspective
- Something no one else has exactly
- Your particular contribution

### Finding Your Gift

Your gift might be:
- Something you take for granted
- So natural you don't see it as special
- What you'd do even for free
- What you've always been able to do
- What people most thank you for

## Strengths Shadows

### The Dark Side

Every strength has a shadow:
- Overused, it becomes a weakness
- Underused, it atrophies
- Misapplied, it causes harm

### Common Shadows

Examples:
- **Analytical** → Overthinking, paralysis
- **Empathy** → Over-absorbing others' emotions
- **Leadership** → Controlling, not listening
- **Creativity** → Unrealistic, can't execute
- **Responsibility** → Over-burdened, can't delegate
- **Communication** → Talking too much, not acting

### Managing Shadows

To manage strength shadows:
- Recognize your tendencies
- Know when strength is overactive
- Balance with other strengths
- Get feedback on impact
- Develop complementary abilities

---

<Exercise title="Your Strength Shadows">

## Strengths and Purpose

### Using Strengths in Purpose

- It feels more natural
- It's more likely to succeed

### Matching Strengths to Contribution

Consider:
- What problems could your strengths solve?
- What needs could your strengths meet?
- What roles would use your strengths?
- What kind of work would let you use your gifts?

### Designing for Strength

Design your purpose expression:
- Around what you're good at
- Using your natural advantages
- Minimizing weakness dependence
- Maximizing strength deployment

## Developing Your Strengths

### Strengths Can Grow

Strengths aren't fixed:
- They can be developed
- With practice, they sharpen
- With challenge, they expand
- They become even more valuable

### How to Develop

Develop strengths through:
- Practice (use them more)
- Challenge (stretch them)
- Feedback (refine them)
- Learning (understand them better)
- Application (use them on harder problems)

### Building on Strengths

Focus development:
- Strengths over weaknesses
- Excellence over adequacy
- What works over what doesn't
- What comes naturally over what's forced

---

<Exercise title="Strength Development">

## Owning Your Strengths

### Why Ownership Matters

Many people don't own their strengths:
- False modesty dismisses them
- Comparison makes them seem small
- Familiarity makes them invisible
- Imposter syndrome denies them

### The Cost of Not Owning

When you don't own your strengths:
- You underuse them
- You don't offer what you have
- You stay small
- Purpose goes unexpressed

### Claiming Your Gifts

Owning means:
- Acknowledging what you're good at
- Accepting your capacities without arrogance
- Offering your gifts without apology
- Taking responsibility for developing them
- Using them for contribution

---

<Exercise title="Owning Your Strengths">

Claim ownership of your strengths.

<Journal
  id="sag-own"
  prompt="Claim your strengths:

Write a statement owning your strengths:

'I am genuinely good at ____________.
I have a gift for ____________.

What feels hard about owning your strengths?
