## Your Past Holds Clues

Your purpose isn't invented out of nothing. It emerges from who you've always been. Your history contains clues—patterns, interests, moments of aliveness, recurring themes. This module mines your past to discover what's been there all along.

## Childhood Clues

### What You Loved

Before you knew what you "should" care about, what did you naturally gravitate toward?

- What activities made time disappear?
- What did you do when you had free time?
- What did you want to be when you grew up?
- What fascinated you?
- What did you pretend or play?

### Natural Interests

Your early interests reveal something:
- They weren't chosen for practicality
- They weren't influenced by career concerns
- They emerged from authentic attraction
- They show natural orientation

### What Others Noticed

What did adults notice about you?
- What were you "always doing"?
- What were you good at?
- What set you apart?
- What did people predict for you?

## Flow States

### When Time Disappears

Flow is the state where:
- You're fully absorbed
- Time passes unnoticed
- Effort feels effortless
- You're in your element

- What skills being used?

### Flow and Purpose

Flow activities often indicate:
- Where your strengths lie
- What kind of work suits you
- What challenges engage you
- What context fits you
- Possible purpose directions

## Formative Experiences

### Shaping Events

Certain experiences shape us:
- Challenges overcome
- Difficulties survived
- Transformations experienced
- Encounters that changed you
- Realizations that shifted your direction

### How They Shaped You

These experiences may have:
- Revealed what you're capable of
- Shown what matters to you
- Given you unique understanding
- Created compassion for others
- Provided direction or calling

### From Wound to Purpose

Sometimes our greatest wounds become sources of purpose:
- What you've overcome you can help others with
- What you've suffered you understand deeply
- What you've learned you can teach
- What you've healed you can facilitate

<Exercise title="Formative Experiences">

## Recurring Themes

### Patterns Across Time

Looking across your life, what themes keep appearing?
- What interests persist?
- What problems do you keep trying to solve?
- What topics do you return to?
- What roles do you naturally take?
- What causes draw you?

### The Through-Line

There's often a through-line:
- Something you've always cared about
- A thread running through different chapters
- A consistent orientation
- A recurring question or concern
- A persistent pull

### Recognizing It

The through-line may be:
- Obvious once you see it
- Hidden in plain sight
- Expressed in different forms at different times
- Easy to miss because it's so natural to you
- The thing you thought "everyone" cared about

<Exercise title="Finding Your Through-Line">

## What You've Always Known

### Early Knowing

Some people have a sense of purpose from early on:
- "I always knew I would..."
- "I've always been drawn to..."
- "Something in me always wanted to..."
- "I've never been able to shake..."

### Buried Knowledge

Sometimes you know but it's buried:
- Dismissed as impractical
- Told it wasn't realistic
- Pushed aside for "real" concerns
- Forgotten but not gone
- Waiting to be recovered

### Recovering What You Know

Questions to unearth buried knowing:
- What have you always known about yourself?
- What have you been told to forget?
- What keeps coming back?
- What did you once know that you've dismissed?
- What would you pursue if nothing stopped you?

---

<Exercise title="What You've Always Known">

  prompt="Recover what you've always known:

• What have you always known about yourself?
• What did you once know about your direction?

- **Flow states:** Where time disappears indicates natural fit
- **Formative experiences:** What shaped you may point to what you're here to do
- **Recurring themes:** Patterns across time reveal the through-line
- **Buried knowledge:** You may already know but have dismissed what you know
- **Synthesis:** Bringing clues together reveals direction

---

<Callout type="important">
Your purpose isn't created from nothing—it's discovered in who you've always been. The clues are in your history: what you loved as a child, what brings you alive, what you've overcome, what keeps recurring. The past isn't just past—it's the foundation of what you're here to do.

*Your history is a map. Read it carefully.*
