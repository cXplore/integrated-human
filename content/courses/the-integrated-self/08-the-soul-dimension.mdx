## The Soul Completes Integration

Integration isn't only psychological—it includes the spiritual dimension. Without connection to meaning, purpose, and something larger than self, integration remains incomplete. The soul dimension grounds all other integration in something that matters.

## What "Soul" Means Here

### Beyond Religion

Soul in this context:
- Not necessarily religious
- The deepest self
- Connection to meaning and purpose
- The transcendent dimension
- What makes life worth living

### The Soul Function

Soul provides:
- Sense of meaning
- Connection to the larger
- Purpose and direction
- Context for suffering
- The "why" of existence

### Soul Fragmentation

Soul fragments through:
- Loss of meaning
- Disconnection from purpose
- Living only on surface
- No sense of something larger
- Existential emptiness

## Connecting to Purpose

- What makes you come alive
- What calls you forward

### Living Purpose

Purpose is lived by:
- Aligning actions with values
- Making choices from purpose
- Letting purpose guide decisions
- Returning to purpose when lost
- Continuously recommitting

<Callout type="important">
