moduleNumber: 2
description: "Discovering the parts of yourself that have split off"

## Parts Work

We all have parts—different aspects of ourselves that sometimes feel like separate entities. Some parts we know well. Others have been exiled, hidden away so long we've forgotten they exist. Integration begins with mapping what's there.

This module helps you identify your fragments.

## Understanding Parts

### We All Have Parts

This is normal:
- Different situations bring out different aspects
- We have conflicting desires and impulses
- Various "voices" exist within us
- This isn't pathology—it's human

### Parts as Adaptations

Parts develop because:
- Different situations required different responses
- Some aspects needed to be hidden
- Protectors emerged to handle threat
- We learned to compartmentalize

### The Ecosystem of Self

Your psyche is an ecosystem:
- Many parts coexisting
- Some in harmony, some in conflict
- Some dominating, some exiled
- All serving some function

---

## Types of Parts

### Everyday Parts

Parts we easily recognize:
- The worker
- The playful one
- The responsible one
- The caretaker
- The critic

### Protector Parts

Parts that defend:
- The controller (manages through control)
- The perfectionist (protects through performance)
- The avoider (protects through withdrawal)
- The fighter (protects through aggression)
- The pleaser (protects through accommodation)

### Exiled Parts

Parts pushed away:
- The wounded one
- The needy one
- The angry one
- The scared one
- Parts deemed unacceptable

### The Self

Beneath parts:
- Core self that isn't a part
- The awareness that knows parts
- The one who can integrate
- Whole, already present

  prompt="Identify parts you're aware of:

• What 'modes' do you have? (Work mode, social mode, etc.)
• What different aspects come out in different situations?
• What conflicting voices exist in you?
• What parts do you present to the world?
• What parts do you hide?"

### Part 2: Naming Parts

<Journal
  id="myf-naming"
  prompt="Name some of your parts:

List at least 5 parts and describe each briefly:
• What is this part like?
• What does it want?
• When does it appear?
• What does it protect you from?
• How does it feel about other parts?"

## Protector Parts

### What Protectors Do

Protectors emerged to:
- Handle threats
- Manage overwhelming experiences
- Maintain connection and survival
- Keep exiled parts hidden
- Keep you functioning

### Common Protector Strategies

Protectors work through:
- **Control:** Managing through order, planning, perfectionism
- **Numbing:** Checking out, dissociating, substances
- **Distraction:** Busyness, entertainment, anything to avoid
- **Performance:** Being what others want, perfectionism
- **Aggression:** Fighting, pushing away, defensiveness
- **Withdrawal:** Avoiding, hiding, isolation

### Protectors Aren't Bad

Important to understand:
- Protectors are trying to help
- They developed for good reason
- They carry burden
- They need appreciation, not attack

---

<Exercise title="Mapping Protectors">

Identify your protector parts.

<Journal
  id="myf-protectors"
  prompt="Explore your protector parts:

For each protector you can identify:
• What strategy does it use? (Control, numbing, performance, etc.)
• What is it protecting you from?
• When did it develop?
• What triggers it to activate?
• What does it fear would happen if it stopped protecting?

Identify at least 3 protector parts."

## Exiled Parts

### What Exiles Are

Exiled parts are:
- Aspects pushed out of awareness
- Parts carrying pain, shame, fear
- Pieces of you deemed unacceptable
- Hidden even from yourself

### How Parts Get Exiled

Parts get exiled through:
- Trauma (too painful to integrate)
- Rejection by others (learned to hide)
- Shame (can't accept this about self)
- Cultural messages (this isn't okay)
- Family dynamics (this isn't allowed)

### The Burden of Exile

Exiled parts:
- Carry frozen pain
- Remain stuck at the age of exile
- Long to return
- Leak out in symptoms
- Hold valuable energy

<Exercise title="Sensing Exiles">

Begin to identify exiled parts.

<Journal
  id="myf-exiles"
  prompt="Explore what might be exiled:

• What emotions are hardest for you to feel? (These may contain exiled parts)
• What about yourself do you most hate or reject?
• What would be most shameful for others to know about you?
• What parts of yourself did you have to hide growing up?
• What do your strongest reactions tell you about what's hidden?

Try to identify at least 2-3 exiled parts."

## Relationships Between Parts

### Parts Interact

Parts relate to each other:
- Some parts conflict
- Some parts protect other parts
- Some parts hate other parts
- Some parts are allied

### The Inner System

Your internal system has:
- Dynamics between parts
- Power struggles
- Alliances and conflicts
- Patterns of interaction

### Common Dynamics

Typical patterns:
- Critic attacks vulnerable parts
- Protector keeps exiles hidden
- Parts polarize (one extreme triggers another)
- Self gets obscured by parts

---

<Exercise title="Part Relationships">

Map how your parts relate.

<Journal
  id="myf-relations"
  prompt="Explore relationships between parts:

• Which of your parts are in conflict with each other?
• Which parts trigger other parts?
• Which parts try to protect other parts?
• What parts do you notice most often? (These may be dominant)
• What parts rarely appear? (These may be suppressed)

Draw or describe the dynamics between your parts."

## The Self Beneath Parts

### You Are Not Your Parts

Important distinction:
- Parts are aspects, not the whole
- You are more than any part
- There is a Self beneath parts
- This Self can relate to all parts

### Qualities of Self

The Self is characterized by:
- Calmness
- Curiosity
- Compassion
- Clarity
- Confidence
- Courage
- Creativity
- Connectedness

### Self-Leadership

Integration involves:
- Self leading the parts
- Not parts running the show
- Relating to parts with compassion
- All parts welcome under Self leadership

---

<Exercise title="Finding Self">

Connect to the Self beneath parts.

<Journal
  id="myf-self"
  prompt="Explore your relationship to Self:

• When do you feel most like 'yourself'—not performing, not protecting?
• When have you experienced calmness, clarity, compassion toward yourself?
• Can you sense a 'you' that observes all the parts?
• What does it feel like when no part is running the show?
• What would Self-leadership look like in your life?"

## Your Parts Map

### Creating a Complete Map

Elements of your map:
- Protector parts (with their strategies)
- Exiled parts (with their burdens)
- Relationships between parts
- Dominant and hidden parts
- Your access to Self

### This Is Working Material

Your map:
- Will evolve as you learn more
- Doesn't need to be perfect
- Is a tool, not the territory
- Helps you understand yourself

<Exercise title="Complete Parts Map">

Create a comprehensive parts map.

<Journal
  id="myf-complete"
  prompt="Draw or describe your complete parts map:

PROTECTOR PARTS:
(List each with its strategy and what it protects)

EXILED PARTS:
(List each with what it carries)

DYNAMICS:
(How parts relate to each other)

DOMINANT PARTS:
(Which run the show most)

HIDDEN PARTS:
(Which are most pushed away)

SELF:

## Working With Your Map

### What Comes Next

In the following modules:
- We'll work with each dimension
- Parts will be relevant throughout
- The goal is integration, not elimination
- All parts belong

### Approaching Parts With Compassion

As you proceed:
- Don't try to get rid of parts
- Approach with curiosity
- Appreciate what parts have done for you
- All parts carry value

### The Integration Process

Integration means:

<Callout type="important">
Your parts map is a living document. As you continue this course, you'll discover more about your parts, see dynamics more clearly, and understand the system better. Return to this map throughout the course. Let it evolve as you do.
</Callout>

*Every part of you developed for a reason. Integration isn't about killing parts—it's about helping them find their rightful place in the whole.*
