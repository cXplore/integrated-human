## How to Set Boundaries

### The Basic Formula

Setting a boundary:
1. Get clear on what you need
2. State it simply and directly
3. Without over-explaining or apologizing excessively
4. Be willing to maintain it

### Example Language

- "I need..."
- "I'm not available to..."
- "That doesn't work for me"
- "I'm not comfortable with..."
- "My limit is..."

### Keep It Simple

Don't over-explain:
- ❌ "I'm so sorry, I know you really need this, and I hate to say no, but I just can't because..."
- ✅ "I'm not able to do that this time."

## Maintaining Boundaries

### People May Resist

When you set boundaries:
- Some people will push back
- This doesn't mean the boundary is wrong
- You may need to restate it
- Actions follow words

### Consistency Matters

Boundaries require:
- Following through
- Not backing down when pressed
- Consistency over time
- Actions that match your words

### When They're Violated

If boundaries are crossed:
- Restate the boundary
- Implement consequences if necessary
- Evaluate the relationship
- Consider if this person can respect you
