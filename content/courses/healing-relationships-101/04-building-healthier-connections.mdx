## Starting with Yourself

### Self-Relationship First

Your relationship with yourself:

- Is often overlooked
- Deserves attention

- Without harsh judgment
- With patience

### Self-Respect

Self-respect shows in:
- The boundaries you set
- How you let others treat you
- The care you give yourself
- The standards you hold

## Choosing Consciously

### Who You Connect With

Not all relationships can be healthy:
- Some people won't change
- Some dynamics are toxic
- You can choose who's in your life
- Quality over quantity

In healthy connections:
- Mutual respect

## Small Steps Forward

### Start Where You Are

- Make small changes
- Build gradually

### Practice Areas

What to practice:

- One communication improvement
- One pattern to interrupt
- One new way of responding

### Patience with Change

Remember:
- Relationships take time to shift
- Others may need time to adjust
- Old patterns will resurface
- Progress, not perfection

<Callout type="important">
Healthier relationships are possible—starting now. You don't need to overhaul everything at once. Pick one skill, one relationship, one change. Practice it. Let it become natural. Then build from there. The patterns that took years to form won't change overnight, but with awareness and consistent practice, they will change. You deserve relationships that nourish you.
