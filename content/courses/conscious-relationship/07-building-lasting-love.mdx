## What Makes Love Last

Some relationships last a lifetime and deepen with every year. Others don't survive the first crisis. What's the difference?

It's not compatibility. It's not luck. It's not finding "the one."

**It's what you build together, day after day, choice after choice.**

## The Seven Principles (Gottman)

Decades of research reveal what lasting couples do:

### 1. Build Love Maps
Know your partner's inner world—their dreams, fears, hopes, preferences, history.

### 2. Share Fondness and Admiration
Express appreciation. See their positive qualities. Say it out loud.

### 3. Turn Toward Each Other
Respond to bids for connection. Small moments of turning toward add up.

### 4. Accept Influence
Be willing to be shaped by your partner. Especially important for men.

### 5. Solve Solvable Problems
Use skills to address issues that can be resolved.

### 6. Overcome Gridlock
Navigate perpetual problems by understanding the dreams beneath positions.

### 7. Create Shared Meaning
Build rituals, goals, roles, and symbols that give relationship deeper purpose.

## The Compound Effect

Love is built in the small moments, not the grand gestures.

### What Compounds:
- Tiny kindnesses
- Small attentions
- Brief moments of presence
- Little repairs
- Daily appreciations

### The Math:
One moment of turning toward vs. turning away seems small. But over years:
- 10 turns toward per day = 3,650 per year
- 10 turns away per day = 3,650 missed connections per year

**It compounds. In either direction.**

## Choosing Each Other

Lasting love requires ongoing choice.

### The Myth:
"We fell in love and stayed that way."

### The Reality:
Love is chosen, day after day. The initial falling is involuntary. The staying is voluntary.

### What Choosing Looks Like:
- Turning toward when you could turn away
- Staying when leaving would be easier
- Investing when coasting is possible
- Recommitting when doubts arise
- Prioritizing when distractions beckon

**Every day, you choose this person and this relationship. Or you don't.**

## The Five to One Ratio

Research shows stable relationships have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

### What Counts as Positive:
- Showing interest
- Expressing affection
- Showing appreciation
- Turning toward
- Humor and play

### What Counts as Negative:
- Criticism
- Defensiveness
- Contempt
- Stonewalling
- Dismissing

### The Takeaway:
You need FIVE positive interactions to balance every negative one. That's a lot of deposits to offset one withdrawal.

## Building Trust

Trust is the foundation. Without it, nothing else works.

### Trust is Built By:
- Doing what you say
- Being reliable
- Keeping confidences
- Showing up consistently
- Prioritizing the relationship
- Being honest

### Trust is Destroyed By:
- Breaking promises
- Lying
- Betrayal
- Inconsistency
- Putting other things first
- Keeping secrets

### Rebuilding Trust:
If trust has been broken, it can be rebuilt—but slowly, through consistent actions over time. Words won't do it. Only demonstrated trustworthiness restores trust.

## Creating Shared Meaning

The deepest relationships share meaning beyond the day-to-day.

### Elements of Shared Meaning:
- **Rituals:** Regular practices that matter to both
- **Roles:** How you each contribute to the partnership
- **Goals:** Shared vision for the future
- **Symbols:** Things that represent your relationship
- **Narratives:** The story you tell about your relationship

### Why It Matters:
Shared meaning answers: Why are we together? What are we building? What's this about?

Without shared meaning, relationship feels empty even when functional.

---

## The Long View

Lasting love requires the long view.

### Short-Term Thinking:
- Win this argument
- Feel good now
- Avoid discomfort today

### Long-Term Thinking:
- Protect the relationship
- Build for decades
- Invest in the future

### The Shift:
"Is what I'm about to do good for our relationship in 10 years?"

/>

## Love as Practice

Love isn't a feeling you have. It's a practice you do.

### Love as Daily Practice:
- Paying attention
- Showing up
- Being present
- Giving generously
- Receiving graciously
- Forgiving readily
- Choosing consistently

### The Practice Mindset:
You're not "in love" or "out of love." You're practicing love—well or poorly, often or rarely.

**Improve the practice, improve the love.**
