## The Patterns Running Your Relationship

You think you're choosing consciously. You think you're responding to what's actually happening in front of you.

But most of the time, you're running programs—patterns installed in childhood, triggered by your partner, playing out automatically.

**Until you see these patterns, they run your relationship.**

---

## What We Bring to Partnership

When you enter a relationship, you don't come empty. You bring:

### Your Attachment Style
How you learned to bond:
- Do you seek closeness or distance?
- Do you trust or test?
- What feels like love to you?

### Your Relationship Templates
What you saw modeled:
- How did your parents relate?
- What was conflict like?
- What was love supposed to look like?

### Your Wounds
What still hurts:
- Where you were abandoned, rejected, controlled
- What you're still trying to heal
- What you're protecting

### Your Strategies
What you learned to do to survive:
- Please, perform, withdraw, control
- Hide parts of yourself
- Show up in specific ways

---

## Projection: The Relationship Distortion

Projection is seeing in your partner what's actually in you.

### How It Works:
- You have disowned parts of yourself
- You see those parts in your partner
- You react to your partner as if they ARE those parts
- You're not seeing them—you're seeing yourself

### Common Projections:
- Seeing your critical parent in your partner
- Seeing your ex in your partner
- Seeing your worst fears confirmed
- Seeing what you want to see, not what's there

### Example:
**Partner says:** "Could you help with the dishes?"
**You hear:** Criticism, control, "you never do enough" (your mom's voice)
**You react:** Defensively, angrily
**What's happening:** You're reacting to your projection, not your partner.

<Exercise title="Your Relationship Patterns">

### Part 1: What You Brought

<Journal
  id="patterns-family"
  prompt="What was the relationship between your parents (or primary caregivers)? How did they handle conflict, affection, communication?"
  placeholder="Their relationship was characterized by...&#10;&#10;Conflict was handled by...&#10;&#10;Affection looked like...&#10;&#10;Communication was..."
  rows={10}
/>

<Journal
  id="patterns-lessons"
  prompt="What did you learn about love and relationship from watching your parents? What beliefs did you form?"
  placeholder="I learned that love means...&#10;&#10;I formed these beliefs about relationship:&#10;&#10;The role of a partner is..."
  rows={8}
/>

### Part 2: Your Patterns

<Checklist
  id="patterns-tendencies"
  title="In relationships, I tend to: (Check all that apply)"
  items={[
    "Prioritize my partner's needs over mine",
    "Withdraw when things get tense",
    "Become critical or controlling",
    "Seek constant reassurance",
    "Avoid conflict at all costs",
    "Push for closeness when they need space",
    "Create distance when they get close",
    "Lose myself in the relationship",
    "Stay independent to protect myself",
    "Test my partner's love"
  ]}
/>

<Journal
  id="patterns-repeat"
  prompt="What patterns keep repeating in your relationships? What happens again and again, with different partners?"
  placeholder="The pattern that keeps repeating is...&#10;&#10;This shows up as...&#10;&#10;It usually leads to..."
  rows={8}
/>

## Triggers: Windows Into the Unconscious

When you get triggered by your partner, you're not reacting to now—you're reacting to then.

### What Triggers Tell You:
- Unhealed wounds
- Old programming running
- Parts of you that need attention
- Where growth wants to happen

### Common Triggers:
- Feeling not chosen
- Feeling controlled
- Feeling criticized
- Feeling dismissed
- Feeling abandoned
- Feeling not good enough

### The Gift of Triggers:
Triggers show you what needs healing. Without relationship, you might never see these patterns. Your partner is (unintentionally) your best teacher.

---

## The Negative Cycle

Most couples have a predictable negative cycle—a dance they do when triggered.

### Common Pattern: Pursue-Withdraw
**A gets triggered** → A pursues (seeks reassurance, connection, answers)
**B feels overwhelmed** → B withdraws (needs space, shuts down)
**A feels more triggered** → A pursues harder
**B feels more overwhelmed** → B withdraws more
Repeat until explosion or exhaustion.

### Other Patterns:
- **Attack-Attack:** Both escalate, fight for control
- **Withdraw-Withdraw:** Both shut down, cold distance
- **Over-function/Under-function:** One does everything, one does nothing

### The Cycle Is the Enemy
It's not you vs. your partner. It's both of you vs. the cycle. The cycle is the problem.

---

<Exercise title="Your Negative Cycle">

<Journal
  id="cycle-pattern"
  prompt="What is your typical negative cycle with a partner? What happens first, then what, then what? Trace the pattern."
  placeholder="When conflict starts, I usually...&#10;&#10;Then they...&#10;&#10;Then I...&#10;&#10;This leads to..."
  rows={10}
/>

<Journal
  id="cycle-role"
  prompt="What is your typical role in the cycle? Pursuer, withdrawer, attacker, over-functioner?"
  placeholder="I usually play the role of...&#10;&#10;I do this because...&#10;&#10;What I'm actually needing underneath:"
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="cycle-underneath"
  prompt="What's really happening underneath your surface behavior? What are you actually feeling? What are you really needing?"
  placeholder="Underneath my [pursuing/withdrawing/attacking], I'm actually feeling...&#10;&#10;What I really need is..."
  rows={6}
/>

## Choosing the Same Person

Ever notice you keep choosing similar partners? There's a reason.

### Why We Choose Who We Choose:
- Familiarity (it "feels like home"—even if home was painful)
- Unfinished business (trying to heal old wounds with new partners)
- Complementary patterns (your pattern fits theirs)
- Projection (seeing what you want/fear, not what's there)

### The Unconscious Logic:
"If I can just get THIS person to love me the way I needed to be loved as a child, I'll finally be healed."

The problem: You're trying to fix the past through the present. Different person, same dynamic.

---

## Shadow in Relationships

Your shadow—the parts of yourself you've disowned—shows up intensely in relationship.

### What You Deny in Yourself:
- You'll be attracted to it in others
- You'll be repelled by it in others
- You'll project it onto your partner

### Example:
You've disowned your anger (you're "the nice one"). Your partner's anger infuriates you. You don't see that you have that same anger—buried.

### The Invitation:
What bothers you most about your partner might be a disowned part of you. What attracts you most might be a disowned part too.

---

## Differentiation: The Goal

The goal isn't to stop triggering each other. That's impossible. The goal is **differentiation.**

### Differentiation Means:
- Staying yourself while staying connected
- Not losing yourself in relationship
- Not needing your partner to feel a certain way for you to be okay
- Tolerating your partner being different from you
- Regulating yourself rather than demanding they change

### Low Differentiation:
- Fusing: losing yourself
- Reactive: they feel something, you feel it
- Can't tolerate difference
- Need them to agree/approve

### High Differentiation:
- You can be close AND separate
- Their emotions don't destabilize you
- You can hold your position without attacking
- You stay connected through disagreement

---

<Exercise title="Differentiation Assessment">

<Checklist
  id="diff-signs"
  title="Signs of low differentiation: (Check what applies to you)"
  items={[
    "I can't relax unless my partner is okay",
    "Their mood directly affects my mood",
    "I avoid saying what I really think to keep peace",
    "I need their approval for my decisions",
    "I feel responsible for their feelings",
    "I lose track of what I want in relationship",
    "I can't handle when they disagree with me",
    "I try to control how they feel about me"
  ]}
/>

<Journal
  id="diff-growth"
  prompt="Where do you struggle most with differentiation? Where do you lose yourself or become too reactive?"
  placeholder="I struggle with differentiation when...&#10;&#10;I tend to lose myself by...&#10;&#10;I become too reactive when..."
  rows={8}
/>

## Becoming Conscious

The shift from unconscious to conscious relating:

### Unconscious:
- Patterns run automatically
- You react, then wonder what happened
- You blame your partner for your feelings
- You see your projections as truth
- The past controls the present

### Conscious:
- You notice patterns as they arise
- You pause before reacting
- You own your triggers and feelings
- You question your projections
- You respond from choice, not conditioning

**This doesn't happen instantly. It's a practice, developed over time.**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Unconscious Relating:** Patterns from the past running your relationship without your awareness.

- **Projection:** Seeing in your partner what's actually in you—your wounds, your disowned parts.

- **Negative Cycle:** The predictable dance you do when triggered. The cycle is the enemy, not your partner.

- **Differentiation:** The ability to stay yourself while staying connected. The goal of relational growth.

- **Triggers as Teachers:** Your reactions reveal what needs healing in you.

---

## What's Next

In Module 2, you'll learn how to use relationship as a path for growth—how to transform triggers into healing and conflict into evolution.

**Before moving on:**
- Notice when you're projecting onto your partner
- Identify your role in your negative cycle
- Practice observing your patterns without judging them

---

*Your partner is not the cause of your triggers—they're the revealer. What they reveal is your opportunity for growth.*
