For acute stress in the moment:
- Breathing techniques
- Grounding exercises

## Building Your Personal Toolkit

### What Works for You

Effective tools are:

- Diverse (different tools for different situations)

### The Toolkit

Aim for:
- 2-3 immediate tools you can use anywhere
- 2-3 short-term processing tools
- 3-5 long-term baseline practices
- Knowledge of when to use each

## Key Concepts

- **Toolkit approach:** Resilience is practices, not personality
- **Three timescales:** Immediate, short-term, long-term tools
- **Immediate tools:** Breathing, grounding, movement
- **Short-term tools:** Processing, support, boundaries
- **Long-term tools:** Daily practices, stress inoculation, mindfulness
- **Personalization:** Build a toolkit that works for your unique system

<Callout type="important">
The best toolkit is one you'll actually use. Don't aim for perfection—aim for practical. Pick a few tools that resonate, practice them regularly, and have them ready when stress hits. Over time, you'll expand and refine your toolkit. But start simple, start now, and start with what feels accessible.
</Callout>

*Your toolkit is only as good as your practice. Choose your tools and use them.*
