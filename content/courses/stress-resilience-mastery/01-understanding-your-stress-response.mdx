## Your Stress System

Stress isn't the enemy—it's information. Your stress response is an ancient, intelligent system designed to help you survive and adapt. Understanding how it works is the first step to working with it, not against it.

---

## What Is Stress?

Stress is:
- Your body's response to demands

## The Stress Response System

### The Fight-Flight-Freeze Response

When you perceive threat:
1. **Amygdala** detects danger
2. **Hypothalamus** sounds the alarm
3. **Adrenals** release stress hormones
4. **Body** prepares for action

### Physical Changes

Your body prepares by:
- Heart rate increases
- Breathing quickens
- Muscles tense
- Digestion slows
- Focus narrows

### The Problem

This system evolved for:
- Physical threats
- Short-term dangers
- Clear resolution

But modern stress is often:
- Psychological
- Chronic
- Never fully resolved

---

## Your Personal Stress Response

### How You React

People respond differently:
- **Fighters:** Get angry, confrontational
- **Flighters:** Avoid, escape, withdraw
- **Freezers:** Shut down, disconnect, go numb
- **Fawners:** People-please, appease, submit

### Your Default

Most people have a default response:
- It's usually automatic
- It was learned early
- It may not serve you now
- It can be changed

---

<Exercise title="Your Default Response">

Identify your typical stress response.

MY DEFAULT:
Fight, flight, freeze, or fawn? Or a combination?

WHERE IT CAME FROM:
When did you learn this response?

HOW IT SHOWS UP:
What does it look like in your life now?

DOES IT SERVE:
Does this response serve you or limit you?

WHAT I WANT:
What response would serve you better?"

<Callout type="important">
Stress isn't something to eliminate—it's something to work with. Your stress response is trying to protect you. When you understand it, you can guide it. When you resist it, it fights harder. The goal isn't a stress-free life; it's a life where you can meet stress with resilience and recover with wisdom.
