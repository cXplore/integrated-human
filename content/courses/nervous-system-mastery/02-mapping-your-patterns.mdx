## Your Unique Nervous System

Everyone's nervous system has the same basic architecture, but how it responds is shaped by:

- **Genetics:** Baseline temperament and sensitivity
- **Early experiences:** How caregivers regulated (or didn't regulate) you
- **Trauma history:** Events that overwhelmed your capacity
- **Current lifestyle:** Sleep, diet, exercise, stress load
- **Relationships:** The co-regulation available to you

This module helps you map YOUR specific patterns so you can work with them precisely.

## Your Triggers

Triggers are cues—internal or external—that shift your nervous system state.

### Common Sympathetic Triggers (Fight/Flight)

**External:**
- Conflict or criticism
- Time pressure
- Loud or chaotic environments
- Feeling watched or evaluated
- Boundary violations
- Unexpected changes

**Internal:**
- Certain thoughts or memories
- Physical sensations (racing heart, tightness)
- Anticipatory anxiety
- Shame or embarrassment
- Feeling out of control

### Common Dorsal Triggers (Shutdown)

**External:**
- Overwhelming demands
- Feeling trapped or helpless
- Prolonged stress without relief
- Social rejection or isolation
- Situations resembling past trauma

**Internal:**
- Exhaustion
- Hopelessness thoughts
- Feeling unseen or unheard
- Too much sympathetic activation
- Accumulated stress

## Your Tells

"Tells" are the signals your body gives when your state is shifting. The earlier you catch them, the easier it is to intervene.

### Early Warning Signs of Sympathetic Activation

**Physical:**
- Jaw tightening
- Shoulders rising
- Breath becoming shallow
- Heart rate increasing
- Stomach tightening
- Hands clenching

**Mental/Emotional:**
- Thoughts speeding up
- Irritability rising
- Focus narrowing
- Patience decreasing
- Vigilance increasing

### Early Warning Signs of Dorsal Shutdown

**Physical:**
- Heaviness in limbs
- Energy draining
- Posture collapsing
- Yawning or sighing
- Feeling cold
- Eyes glazing

**Mental/Emotional:**
- Brain fog
- Numbness spreading
- Motivation disappearing
- Disconnect from body
- "What's the point" thoughts

---

## Your Habitual State

Most people have a default state they return to—especially under stress.

### The Sympathetic Default

Some people run "hot." Their system tends toward activation:
- Often anxious or on edge
- Difficulty relaxing
- Sleep problems (can't turn off)
- Quick to anger or frustration
- Hypervigilant
- Often described as "intense"

**Origin often includes:** Unpredictable environments, having to be alert to stay safe, anxious caregivers.

### The Dorsal Default

Some people run "cold." Their system tends toward shutdown:
- Often tired or depleted
- Difficulty getting motivated
- Sleep problems (can't get up)
- Depression-like symptoms
- Dissociation or numbness
- Often described as "checked out"

**Origin often includes:** Overwhelming environments, caregivers who didn't respond to needs, learned helplessness.

### The Swing

Many people swing between the two:
- Periods of high activation
- Followed by crashes into shutdown
- Difficulty finding the middle
- Boom-bust patterns
- Rarely in ventral vagal

<Exercise title="Your Personal Nervous System Map">

Take 20-30 minutes for this detailed mapping.

### Part 1: Your Triggers

<Journal

  prompt="List your top 5 sympathetic triggers (things that activate fight/flight):"
  placeholder="1.&#10;2.&#10;3.&#10;4.&#10;5."

<Journal
  id="ns-dorsal-triggers"
  prompt="List your top 5 dorsal triggers (things that cause shutdown):"
  placeholder="1.&#10;2.&#10;3.&#10;4.&#10;5."
  rows={6}
/>

### Part 2: Your Tells

<Journal
  id="ns-sympathetic-tells"
  prompt="What are your earliest signs of sympathetic activation?
• In your body:
• In your thoughts:
• In your behavior:"
  placeholder="In my body:&#10;&#10;In my thoughts:&#10;&#10;In my behavior:"

• In your body:
• In your thoughts:
• In your behavior:"
  placeholder="In my body:&#10;&#10;In my thoughts:&#10;&#10;In my behavior:"
  rows={6}
/>

### Part 3: Your Default

<Checklist
  id="ns-default-state"
  title="Which state do you tend toward?"
  items={[
    "Sympathetic (running hot) - often anxious, on edge, difficulty relaxing",
    "Dorsal (running cold) - often tired, depleted, difficulty getting motivated",
    "Swing between both - boom-bust patterns, rarely in the middle",
    "Mostly regulated (ventral vagal) - generally calm with good recovery"
  ]}
/>

<Journal
  id="ns-dysregulation-estimate"
  prompt="What percentage of your day do you estimate you spend dysregulated? What does that look like for you?"
  placeholder="I spend roughly ___% of my day dysregulated. This usually looks like..."
  rows={4}
/>

### Part 4: Your History

<Journal
  id="ns-history"
  prompt="Reflect on what shaped your nervous system:
• What experiences might have shaped your patterns?
• How did your caregivers regulate (or fail to regulate)?
• What was the emotional temperature of your childhood home?"
  placeholder="Experiences that shaped my patterns:&#10;&#10;How caregivers regulated me:&#10;&#10;The emotional temperature growing up:"
  rows={10}
/>

### Part 5: Current Influences

<Journal

## Tracking Your States

For the next week, practice tracking your nervous system states throughout the day.

### Simple Tracking Method

Set 3-4 reminders on your phone. When they go off, note:

1. **Current state:** Ventral / Sympathetic / Dorsal
2. **Body sensation:** What do you notice physically?
3. **What happened recently:** Any triggers?
4. **Rating 1-10:** How regulated do you feel?

### What to Look For

After a week of tracking, review for patterns:

- What times of day are you most dysregulated?
- What activities or people shift your state?
- How long do you typically stay dysregulated?
- What helps you return to regulation?

---

## Common Patterns to Notice

### The Morning Pattern
Some people wake dysregulated (cortisol spike, anxiety) and gradually regulate. Others wake regulated and dysregulate as the day progresses.

### The Relationship Pattern
Certain people consistently shift your state—notice who regulates you and who dysregulates you.

### The Environment Pattern
Certain spaces affect your nervous system—work, home, nature, crowds.

### The Accumulation Pattern
Stress accumulates. You might handle individual stressors but become dysregulated when they pile up.

### The Delayed Response
Sometimes dysregulation appears hours or days after the trigger—especially with dorsal responses.

---

## Working With Your Patterns

Once you know your patterns, you can:

### 1. Predict
"I have a difficult meeting tomorrow—I'll likely be activated. I'll plan recovery time after."

### 2. Prepare
"I know crowds dysregulate me. I'll arrive early, find a quiet spot, and have an exit plan."

### 3. Intervene Early
"I notice my jaw tightening—that's my early sign. Time to use a regulation tool before I'm fully activated."

### 4. Design Your Life
"I need more nervous system recovery time. I'm going to reduce my commitments."

## Key Concepts

- **Triggers:** Internal or external cues that shift your nervous system state.

- **Tells:** Early warning signs that your state is changing.

- **Default State:** The state your nervous system tends toward, especially under stress.

- **Window of Tolerance:** Your personal capacity to handle activation without dysregulating.

- **Co-regulation:** How others' nervous systems affect yours (and vice versa).

---

## What's Next

Now that you understand your patterns, Module 3 teaches practical tools for down-regulating—calming an activated nervous system. These are essential skills for when you've shifted into sympathetic overdrive.

Continue tracking your states this week. The better you know your patterns, the more effectively you can work with them.

*Awareness is the first intervention. Knowing your patterns is already changing them.*
