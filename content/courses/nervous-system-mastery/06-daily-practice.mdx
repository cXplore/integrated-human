## Putting It All Together

You now understand:
- How your nervous system works (Module 1)
- Your specific patterns (Module 2)

## The Daily Nervous System Practice

A daily practice doesn't need to be long. 10-15 minutes consistently beats an hour occasionally.

### Morning: Set the Tone

The first 30 minutes of your day significantly impact your nervous system state for hours.

**Don't do:**
- Immediately check phone
- Jump into stress/tasks
- Scroll social media
- Consume news

**Do instead:**
- Breathwork (2-5 minutes)
- Gentle movement or stretching
- Brief meditation or body scan
- Set intention for the day

**Suggested morning sequence (10-15 min):**
1. Upon waking, take 5 slow breaths before reaching for phone
2. 2-3 minutes gentle stretching in bed or standing
3. 2-5 minutes breathwork (box breathing or extended exhale)
4. Brief body scan—how's your nervous system today?
5. Set intention: "Today I will notice when I'm dysregulated and use my tools."

### Throughout the Day: Check-In Points

Set 3-4 reminder points to check your state.

**At each check-in, ask:**
1. What state am I in? (Ventral / Sympathetic / Dorsal)
2. What does my body feel like?
3. What's my breathing like?
4. Do I need a regulation tool?

**If activated:** Use a quick down-regulation technique.
**If shutdown:** Use a quick up-regulation technique.
**If regulated:** Great—notice and appreciate it.

### Transition Moments

Use transitions as regulation opportunities:
- Before/after meals
- Before/after meetings
- When changing locations
- Before difficult conversations
- When context-switching

**Transition practice (30 seconds - 2 minutes):**
- Pause
- Three conscious breaths
- Notice your state
- Adjust if needed
- Proceed with intention

### Evening: Wind Down

The last hour before bed matters for sleep AND for next-day regulation.

**Don't do:**
- Work until bedtime
- Consume stressful content
- Intense exercise
- Bright screens without protection

**Do instead:**
- Dim lights
- Reduce stimulation
- Gentle stretching or yoga
- Down-regulation breathing
- Reflect on the day (briefly)

**Suggested evening sequence (10 min):**
1. 30-60 minutes before bed, reduce stimulation
2. Gentle stretching or foam rolling (5 min)
3. Extended exhale breathing or 4-7-8 breath (3-5 min)
4. Brief gratitude practice or day review
5. Set intention for good sleep

## Your Weekly Practice

### Weekly Review (15-30 min)

Once a week, review your nervous system patterns:

1. **State audit:** How much time did I spend in each state this week?
2. **Pattern recognition:** What triggered dysregulation?
3. **Tool assessment:** Which tools did I use? What worked?
4. **Recovery check:** Did I get enough recovery?
5. **Adjustment:** What will I do differently next week?

### Weekly Capacity Building

Choose 2-3 activities each week that build capacity:
- One physical challenge at your edge
- One emotional/mental challenge at your edge
- One recovery activity (non-negotiable)

### Weekly Maintenance

Things that should happen weekly:
- Extended time in nature
- Social connection with safe people
- Extended down-time (no productivity)
- Physical activity you enjoy
- Something playful

## Making It Stick

### Start Small

Begin with less than you think you need. A 5-minute practice you do daily beats a 30-minute practice you abandon.

### Anchor to Existing Habits

Attach your practice to things you already do:
- Breathwork while coffee brews
- Body scan before getting out of bed
- Check-in during bathroom breaks
- Wind-down when brushing teeth

### Track (Simply)

A simple daily check-in helps:
- Did I do my morning practice? Y/N
- Did I check in during the day? Y/N
- Did I do my evening practice? Y/N
- Overall nervous system state today: 1-10

### Expect Imperfection

You'll miss days. You'll forget. You'll fall off.

When this happens:
1. Don't shame yourself (that's dysregulating)
2. Start again the next day
3. Adjust if the practice wasn't working
4. Remember: progress not perfection

### Notice What Works

Pay attention to what actually shifts your state. Double down on what works for you, even if it's not what "should" work.

## Exercise: Design Your Practice

### Part 1: Your Morning Practice

What time do you wake up?

What could you do before checking your phone?

Design your morning practice (be realistic):

### Part 2: Your Daily Check-Ins

What times will you check in?

What will you check? (State, body, breath?)

What tools will you use if needed?

### Part 3: Your Evening Practice

What time do you go to bed?

What will you stop doing 30-60 min before bed?

Design your evening practice:

### Part 4: Your Weekly Practice

When will you do your weekly review?

What capacity-building activities will you do?

What recovery activities will you protect?

### Part 5: Your Commitment

"For the next 30 days, I commit to:

Daily: ________________

Weekly: ________________

I will track my practice by: ________________

When I miss a day, I will: ________________"

## Final Reflection

Take a few minutes to complete this course with intention.

**What's the most important thing you learned?**

Your nervous system has been trying to protect you your whole life. Now you can work WITH it instead of against it.

Regulation is a skill. Skills develop with practice. Be patient with yourself.

The work you do on your nervous system ripples out to everything—your health, your relationships, your capacity for life.
