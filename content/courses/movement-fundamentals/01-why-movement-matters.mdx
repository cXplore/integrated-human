## We Were Built to Move

Your body evolved to move—constantly, variably, throughout the day.

For millions of years, humans walked, climbed, carried, squatted, reached, and ran as part of daily life. Our bodies developed to support this rich movement vocabulary.

Then we invented chairs. And desks. And cars. And screens.

Now most of us spend our days in positions our bodies weren't designed for, doing almost nothing physically. And our bodies are paying the price.

## The Movement Crisis

### How We Live Now

The average modern person:
- Sits 9-10+ hours per day
- Walks less than 5,000 steps
- Rarely uses full range of motion
- Avoids physical challenges
- Has atrophied movement patterns

This is historically unprecedented.

### The Consequences

Movement poverty leads to:
- Chronic pain (back, neck, joints)
- Muscle weakness and imbalance
- Reduced mobility and flexibility
- Poor posture
- Metabolic issues
- Decreased bone density
- Mental health impacts
- Accelerated aging

Many "diseases of aging" are actually diseases of inactivity.

### It's Not Just About Exercise

An hour of exercise doesn't undo 10+ hours of sitting.

The problem isn't just lack of workouts—it's lack of movement throughout life. Our bodies need consistent, varied movement, not just occasional intense sessions.

## What Your Body Needs

### Movement Through the Day

Your body thrives with:
- Frequent position changes
- Walking as transportation
- Regular getting up and down from floor
- Using stairs
- Carrying and lifting daily loads
- Reaching, bending, twisting in life

Movement should be woven into living, not compartmentalized into "exercise time."

### Full Range of Motion

Use it or lose it applies to mobility:
- Joints that don't move through full range stiffen
- Muscles that aren't lengthened shorten
- Positions you can't get into become impossible
- A young child's mobility becomes an old person's rigidity

Without deliberate effort, we lose the movement capacity we once had.

### Progressive Challenge

Bodies adapt to demands:
- Challenge builds strength
- Comfort maintains or declines
- New movements build new capacities
- Routine without progression leads to plateau

Some physical challenge is essential for health.

### Variety

Repetitive motion is problematic:
- Same movements stress same tissues
- Imbalances develop
- Some capacities atrophy
- The body needs variety

Movement diversity is health.

## Beyond Fitness

### Movement as Human Right

Movement isn't just about fitness metrics. It's about:
- **Autonomy:** Being able to do what you need in life
- **Resilience:** Handling physical challenges when they arise
- **Play:** Access to physical joy
- **Longevity:** Functioning well as you age
- **Integration:** Mind-body connection

### Functional Movement

Functional movement means:
- Movement that serves life
- Ability to do what you need and want
- Strength in the ranges you use
- Physical competence for your environment

Not just looking good—functioning well.

### The Long Game

Movement now is an investment:
- Current quality of life
- Injury prevention
- Healthy aging
- Independence in old age
- Physical freedom throughout life

What you do in your 30s-50s shapes your 70s-90s.

## The Movement Fundamentals Approach

### Principles

This course is built on:

**Functional patterns:** Movements that transfer to real life.

**Progressive development:** Building capacity over time.

**Sustainability:** Practices you can maintain.

**Integration:** Movement as part of life, not separate from it.

**Enjoyment:** Finding pleasure in physical capacity.

### What We'll Cover

**Foundations:** The basic movement patterns underlying everything.

**Mobility:** Creating usable range of motion.

**Strength:** Building functional power.

**Practice:** Creating sustainable movement habits.

**Integration:** Bringing it all together.

### Who This Is For

This course is for:
- People who want to move better
- Those with sedentary jobs/lifestyles
- Anyone who's lost physical capacity
- People returning to movement after break
- Those wanting to build sustainable practice

It's fundamentals—building blocks for whatever you want to do with your body.

<Exercise title="Your Movement Assessment">

Assess your current relationship with movement.

### Part 1: Current Movement Life

<Journal
  id="movement-current"
  prompt="Assess your current movement patterns:

• How much do you sit per day?
• How much do you walk?
• What physical activities do you do regularly?
• When did you last get up from the floor using no hands?
• What movements feel difficult or impossible?"
  placeholder="Hours sitting per day:

### Part 2: Physical Function

<Checklist
  id="movement-function"
  items={[
    "Can get up and down from floor easily",
    "Can deep squat comfortably",
    "Can touch toes without strain",
    "Can raise arms fully overhead",
    "Can walk several miles without issue",
    "Can carry groceries without difficulty",
    "Can climb stairs without getting winded",
    "Can run if needed (catch a bus, play with kids)"
  ]}
/>

<Journal

### Part 3: Your Movement Goals

<Journal
  id="movement-goals"
  prompt="Consider what you want from movement:

• What physical capacities do you want to have?
• What activities would you like to do?
• What would improved movement mean for your life?
• What's getting in the way of moving more?
• What would success look like for you?"

## Getting Started

### Where You Are Is Where You Start

Whatever your current level, that's the starting point.

No judgment about where you are. Bodies adapt. Capacity can be rebuilt. Progress is possible at any age.

### Small Moves

You don't need to overhaul your life:
- Add movement where you can
- Build gradually
- Focus on consistency over intensity
- Make it sustainable

### The Journey

Building movement capacity is a journey, not a destination:
- You'll develop gradually
- There will be setbacks
- The goal is trajectory, not perfection
- Movement becomes more enjoyable as capacity grows

## Key Concepts

- **Movement crisis:** Modern life doesn't provide the movement bodies need
- **Throughout the day:** Movement should be woven into life, not just exercise time
- **Use it or lose it:** Capacity you don't maintain, you lose
- **Functional movement:** Physical competence for real life
- **Long game:** What you do now shapes your future physical freedom

<Callout type="important">
If you have injuries, chronic pain, or medical conditions, consult healthcare providers before starting a new movement program. This course provides general education—individual conditions require individual attention.
