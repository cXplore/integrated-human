## Practice, Not Workout

A workout is something you do.
A practice is something you are.

The difference matters. Workouts are events—you do them and then stop. Practice is ongoing—it becomes part of your life, part of who you are.

Building a movement practice, not just a workout routine, is the key to lasting physical health.

## What Makes Practice Sustainable

### Enjoyment

You'll keep doing what you enjoy:
- Find movement that's actually pleasurable
- Not just tolerating for results
- Intrinsic reward, not just instrumental
- Look forward to it, don't dread it

This is personal—what others love might not work for you.

### Integration

Practice works when it fits your life:
- Works with your schedule, not against it
- Doesn't require heroic effort to maintain
- Part of your identity and routine
- Not constantly battling to make time

### Manageable Challenge

Too easy gets boring. Too hard leads to failure.

The sweet spot:
- Challenging enough to engage
- Doable enough to consistently accomplish
- Progressive enough to see development
- Not so demanding it overwhelms

### Flexibility

Sustainable practice adapts:
- Different on high-energy and low-energy days
- Adjusts to life circumstances
- Has backup plans
- Doesn't break when disrupted

All-or-nothing approaches fail.

## Building the Habit

### Start Small

The biggest mistake: starting too ambitious.

Instead:
- Begin with something so small you can't fail
- 10 minutes, not 60
- 2x/week, not 7
- Build from success

You can always add more. Starting big often leads to quitting.

### Attach to Existing Habits

Habit stacking works:
- After morning coffee, 5 minutes mobility
- Before shower, quick strength routine
- During lunch break, a walk
- While watching TV, stretching

New habits stick better when attached to existing ones.

### Remove Friction

Make movement easier:
- Clothes ready
- Equipment accessible
- No decisions required
- Clear time in schedule

The fewer obstacles, the more likely you'll do it.

### Track Progress

Tracking helps:
- Simple log of what you did
- Notice improvements over time
- Maintain accountability
- Celebrate progress

Doesn't have to be elaborate—just enough to see you're doing it.

## Types of Movement Practice

### Dedicated Sessions

Structured time for movement:
- Morning mobility routine
- Strength sessions
- Yoga/flexibility work
- Running/cardio

These are the "practice times."

### Movement Throughout Day

Integrated movement:
- Walk instead of drive when possible
- Take stairs
- Squat to pick things up
- Stand and move regularly
- Play with kids/pets
- Carry groceries

Life as movement practice.

### Active Recreation

Movement that's also fun:
- Hiking
- Dancing
- Sports
- Swimming
- Cycling
- Climbing

Exercise that doesn't feel like exercise.

### Recovery and Restoration

Gentle movement:
- Easy stretching
- Walking
- Foam rolling
- Gentle yoga
- Movement on rest days

Part of practice is knowing when to go easy.

## The Weekly Structure

### A Template

Sample sustainable week:
- **Monday:** Strength session (20-30 min)
- **Tuesday:** Walk or light activity
- **Wednesday:** Strength session
- **Thursday:** Walk or active recreation
- **Friday:** Strength session or mobility focus
- **Saturday:** Active recreation (hike, sport, play)
- **Sunday:** Rest or gentle movement

Plus daily: Brief morning mobility, movement throughout day.

### Minimum Effective Dose

If life is crazy, the minimum:
- 2 strength sessions (20 min each)
- Daily walking (even 10 min)
- Brief daily mobility (5 min)

That's enough to maintain and slowly progress.

### Ambitious Version

If you want more:
- 3-4 strength sessions
- Daily conditioning (cardio, sport)
- Daily mobility work
- Active lifestyle throughout day

But start with what's sustainable, not what's ideal.

## When Practice Fails

### Expect Disruptions

Life disrupts practice:
- Travel
- Illness
- Work crunches
- Family demands
- Loss of motivation

This is normal and expected.

### The Return

What matters isn't never missing—it's returning:
- No guilt about the gap
- Start where you are
- Maybe smaller than before
- Rebuild gradually

The practice is returning, not never falling.

### Troubleshooting

If practice keeps failing:
- Too ambitious? Scale down.
- Not enjoyable? Try different movement.
- Obstacles? Address them directly.
- No motivation? Reconnect with why.
- Need support? Find community.

Adjust until it works.

- **Start small:** Begin with what you can't fail at
- **Reduce friction:** Make movement easy
- **Life integration:** Movement throughout day, not just sessions
- **Return:** The practice is coming back, not never missing

<Callout type="important">
The best movement practice is one you'll actually do. Don't copy someone else's ideal routine. Build something that fits your life, interests, and reality. Adjust as you go.
