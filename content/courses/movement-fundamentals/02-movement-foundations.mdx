## The Building Blocks

All complex human movement is built from a few fundamental patterns.

Master these patterns, and you can do almost anything. Neglect them, and dysfunction develops.

These are the movement foundations everyone needs.

---

## The Seven Fundamental Patterns

### 1. Squat

The squat is fundamental:
- Getting up and down from chairs, toilets, floor
- Picking things up
- Playing with children or pets
- Athletic movement

**Key points:**
- Feet about hip-width or slightly wider
- Weight in heels and midfoot
- Knees track over toes (but can go past)
- Hips back and down
- Chest relatively upright
- Full range: thighs parallel or below

**What often goes wrong:**
- Loss of squat depth (can't get low)
- Knees caving inward
- Heels lifting
- Rounding lower back

### 2. Hinge

The hip hinge is bending at the hips while keeping a flat back:
- Picking things up from the ground
- Deadlifts and kettlebell swings
- Explosive movement (jumping, sprinting)
- Bending in daily life

**Key points:**
- Movement primarily at hips, not spine
- Back stays flat or slightly arched
- Knees slightly bent but hips do most work
- Weight in heels
- Core braced

**What often goes wrong:**
- Rounding the lower back
- Using mostly back instead of hips
- Not pushing hips back sufficiently

### 3. Push

Pushing movements:
- Push-ups
- Pressing overhead
- Pushing doors, objects
- Getting up from floor

**Two directions:**
- **Horizontal push:** Push-up, chest press
- **Vertical push:** Overhead press, handstand

**Key points:**
- Stable shoulder position
- Core engaged throughout
- Controlled movement
- Full range of motion

### 4. Pull

Pulling movements:
- Pulling yourself up
- Rowing
- Opening doors
- Climbing

**Two directions:**
- **Horizontal pull:** Rows
- **Vertical pull:** Pull-ups, climbing

**Key points:**
- Initiate from back muscles, not just arms
- Shoulders down and back
- Full range of motion
- Controlled eccentric (lowering)

### 5. Carry

Carrying loads:
- Groceries, luggage, children
- Moving objects
- Farmer's carries
- Loaded walks

**Key points:**
- Tall posture
- Core braced
- Even loading when possible
- Shoulders back and down

Carrying is underrated—it builds real-world strength and stability.

### 6. Lunge/Single-Leg

Single-leg work:
- Walking (essentially alternating lunges)
- Stairs
- Running
- Balance activities

**Key points:**
- Knee tracks over toes
- Hip stability (no dropping/shifting)
- Core engaged
- Controlled movement

Single-leg strength is essential for balance and gait.

### 7. Rotate/Anti-Rotate

Rotational movements:
- Walking (spine rotation)
- Throwing
- Turning
- Most sports

**Two aspects:**
- **Rotation:** Generating rotational force
- **Anti-rotation:** Resisting unwanted rotation

**Key points:**
- Rotation from thoracic spine (upper back), not lower back
- Core controls rotation
- Hip mobility allows rotation without compensation

## Common Movement Dysfunctions

### What Goes Wrong

When patterns are neglected, dysfunctions develop:

**Squat:** Loss of depth, knee collapse, back rounding
**Hinge:** Can't differentiate hinge from squat; back rounding
**Push:** Shoulder instability, limited range
**Pull:** Weak back, dominant arms, limited range
**Carry:** Can't stabilize under load
**Single-leg:** Poor balance, hip drop
**Rotation:** Rotating from lower back, loss of thoracic mobility

### Why It Happens

- Sitting (hip flexors shorten, glutes weaken)
- Lack of practice
- Compensation patterns from old injuries
- Weak core
- Poor mobility
- Not moving through full ranges

### The Good News

Patterns can be restored. With practice, the body relearns proper movement.

## Building the Patterns

### Start with Bodyweight

Before adding load:
- Learn the pattern
- Develop control
- Move through full range
- Make it automatic

Load only patterns that are sound.

### Quality Over Quantity

One good rep teaches more than ten sloppy ones.

Focus on:
- Doing it right
- Feeling the correct muscles work
- Moving with control
- Full range of motion

### Daily Practice

Movement patterns develop through daily practice:
- Squat to the ground throughout the day
- Hinge to pick things up
- Carry things when possible
- Take stairs
- Get up and down from floor

Make life your movement practice.

<Exercise title="Assessing Your Patterns">

Test your fundamental movement patterns.

### Part 1: Squat Assessment

Stand with feet hip-width, arms extended forward. Squat down as low as you can.

<Journal
  id="patterns-squat"
  prompt="Assess your squat:

• How low can you go? (Thighs parallel? Below? Nowhere close?)
• Does your back round?
• Do your heels lift?
• Do your knees cave inward?
• Where do you feel restriction? (Ankles? Hips? Both?)"
  placeholder="How low:

Back rounding:

Heels lifting:

Knees caving:

Where I feel restriction:..."
  rows={12}
/>

### Part 2: Hinge Assessment

Stand and reach hands toward floor while pushing hips back, keeping back flat.

<Journal
  id="patterns-hinge"
  prompt="Assess your hip hinge:

• How far can you reach while keeping back flat?
• Does your lower back want to round?
• Where do you feel the stretch? (Hamstrings should be primary)
• Can you differentiate hip hinge from squat?
• Where do you feel restriction?"
  placeholder="How far I can reach:

Back rounding:

Where I feel stretch:

Can differentiate from squat:

Restriction:..."
  rows={12}
/>

### Part 3: Other Patterns

<Journal
  id="patterns-other"
  prompt="Quick assessment of other patterns:

Push: Can you do a push-up with good form? If not, where do you fail?

Pull: Can you hang from a bar? Do a row?

Carry: How does carrying heavy bags feel?

Single-leg: Can you balance on one leg for 30 seconds? Lunge without wobbling?

Rotation: How does your upper back twist?"
  placeholder="Push:

Pull:

Carry:

Single-leg:

Rotation:..."
  rows={14}
/>

### Part 4: Priority Areas

<Journal
  id="patterns-priority"
  prompt="Based on your assessment:

• Which patterns are strongest?
• Which need the most work?
• What might be causing the limitations? (Mobility? Strength? Practice?)
• What's your priority for improvement?"
  placeholder="Strongest patterns:

Need most work:

Possible causes:

Priority for improvement:..."
  rows={10}

2. Bodyweight squat to box/chair
3. Full bodyweight squat
4. Goblet squat (holding weight)
5. Barbell squat variations

### Hinge Progression

1. Hip hinge drill (against wall)
2. Romanian deadlift with bodyweight
3. Kettlebell deadlift
4. Conventional/sumo deadlift
5. Kettlebell swing

### Push Progression

1. Wall push-up
2. Incline push-up (on stairs or bench)
3. Knee push-up
4. Full push-up
5. Loaded presses

### Pull Progression

1. Bodyweight rows (on rings or bar)
2. Assisted pull-up
3. Negative pull-up
4. Full pull-up
5. Weighted pull-up

Start where you are. Progress when ready.

## Key Concepts

- **Seven patterns:** Squat, hinge, push, pull, carry, lunge, rotate
- **Foundation:** All complex movement builds from these basics
- **Dysfunction:** Patterns degrade without practice
- **Quality first:** Good form before load or volume
- **Daily practice:** Weave patterns into life

<Callout type="important">
If patterns cause pain or feel impossible, there may be underlying issues (mobility restrictions, injuries, structural issues) that need attention. Consider working with a physical therapist or qualified coach for individual assessment.
