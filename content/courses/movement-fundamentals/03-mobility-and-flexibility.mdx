## Range of Motion Matters

Without adequate range of motion, movement patterns break down.

If you can't get into the positions good movement requires, you'll compensate—and compensation leads to dysfunction and injury.

Mobility is the foundation everything else is built on.

## Mobility vs. Flexibility

### Flexibility

Flexibility is passive range of motion:
- How far a muscle can be stretched
- What your body can achieve with external force (gravity, partner, prop)
- Not under your control

### Mobility

Mobility is active range of motion:
- Range you can access and control
- What you can use in movement
- Under muscular control

### Why the Distinction Matters

You can be flexible but not mobile:
- Can stretch leg to face with hands
- But can't lift leg there on your own

Flexibility without mobility doesn't transfer to function.

### The Goal

You need mobility—usable, controlled range of motion.

Flexibility is useful as a stepping stone, but mobility is the goal.

## The Modern Mobility Crisis

### What We've Lost

Most modern adults have lost significant range:
- Can't deep squat
- Can't touch toes
- Limited hip extension
- Rounded thoracic spine
- Restricted shoulders
- Stiff ankles

These losses compound with age if not addressed.

### Why It Matters

Limited mobility affects:
- Movement quality (compensation patterns)
- Injury risk
- Pain (restricted areas often become painful)
- Physical capability
- Posture
- Athletic performance

### It Can Be Restored

The good news: mobility can be restored at any age.

It requires consistent work, but bodies respond. What's lost can largely be regained.

## Key Areas

### Hips

The hips need:
- Flexion (knee to chest)
- Extension (leg behind body)
- Internal rotation
- External rotation
- Abduction (leg out to side)
- Adduction (leg across midline)

Modern life restricts hip mobility significantly. This is a priority area.

### Thoracic Spine

The upper back needs:
- Extension (opening the chest)
- Rotation
- Lateral flexion

Most people are stuck in flexion (rounded forward). This affects shoulders, neck, and breathing.

### Shoulders

Shoulders need:
- Full overhead reach
- Internal and external rotation
- Horizontal abduction and adduction

Shoulder issues are common from desk work and limited movement.

### Ankles

Ankles need:
- Dorsiflexion (ankle bending, foot coming toward shin)

Limited ankle mobility affects squatting and many other movements.

## Approaches to Mobility

### Stretching

Traditional stretching:
- Hold positions for 30+ seconds
- Reaches passive end range
- Effective for increasing flexibility
- Should be combined with active work

### Active Mobility

Controlled movement through range:
- Controlled articular rotations (CARs)
- Active stretching
- End-range strengthening
- Moves flexibility toward mobility

### Loaded Stretching

Stretching while under load:
- Deep squat holds
- Jefferson curls
- Loaded stretches
- Builds strength in stretched positions

### Movement Flow

Flowing through positions:
- Yoga-style sequencing
- Dynamic warm-ups
- Animal movements
- Explores many ranges together

---

## Practical Mobility Work

### Daily Minimum

Aim for daily mobility work, even if brief:
- 5-10 minutes makes a difference
- Focus on priority areas
- Consistency beats occasional long sessions

### Hip Mobility Routine

Sample hip routine (5 minutes):
1. Hip circles (30 seconds each direction)
2. Deep squat hold (1 minute)
3. Couch stretch/hip flexor (30 seconds each side)
4. 90/90 hip switches (1 minute)
5. Pigeon or figure-4 stretch (30 seconds each side)

### Thoracic Mobility Routine

Sample upper back routine (5 minutes):
1. Cat-cow (10 reps)
2. Thread the needle (5 each side)
3. Thoracic extension on foam roller (1 minute)
4. Wall angels (10 reps)
5. Open book rotations (5 each side)

### When to Do It

Timing options:
- Morning movement routine
- Before workouts (dynamic)
- After workouts (when warm)
- Throughout day (movement snacks)
- Evening wind-down

Any time is better than no time.

<Exercise title="Your Mobility Assessment">

Assess your current mobility.

### Part 1: Key Tests

Perform these tests:

**Deep squat:** Can you get into a deep squat, heels down, without falling back?

**Overhead reach:** Lying on back, can you raise arms fully overhead to touch floor?

**Hip flexor length:** In lunge position, is your front hip flexor restricted?

**Thoracic rotation:** Sitting, can you rotate to look behind you 45+ degrees each way?

**Toe touch:** Standing, can you reach your toes with straight legs?

<Journal
  id="mobility-tests"
  prompt="Record your results:

• Deep squat: (describe)
• Overhead reach: (describe)
• Hip flexor: (tight/okay)
• Thoracic rotation: (degrees each way)
• Toe touch: (how far)"
  placeholder="Deep squat:

### Part 2: Priority Areas

<Journal
  id="mobility-priority"
  prompt="Based on your assessment:

• Which areas are most restricted?
• How do these restrictions affect your movement?
• What daily activities are impacted?
• What's your top priority for improvement?
• What secondary areas need work?"
  placeholder="Most restricted:

### Part 3: Your Mobility Plan

<Journal
  id="mobility-plan"
  prompt="Create a simple mobility plan:

• When will you do mobility work? (Morning? Evening? Before workouts?)
• How long? (Start with 5-10 minutes)
• What specific stretches/exercises for your priority areas?
• How often? (Daily is ideal)
• How will you track progress?"

## Common Mistakes

### Too Aggressive

Pushing too hard into stretches can cause:
- Muscle guarding (tightening up)
- Strain
- Inflammation
- Worse mobility

Work at challenging but comfortable ranges. Progress gradually.

### Inconsistent

Occasional stretching doesn't work. Mobility requires:
- Regular practice (daily if possible)
- Patience (changes take weeks/months)
- Consistency (keeps up gains)

### Only Stretching

Flexibility without strength is vulnerable.

Combine stretching with:
- Strengthening in stretched positions
- Active mobility work
- Movement through ranges

### Ignoring the Real Issue

Sometimes tight muscles aren't the problem:
- Stability issues can cause tightness (body protecting itself)
- Nerve tension can mimic muscle tightness
- Joint issues may underlie apparent muscle problems

If mobility work doesn't help after consistent effort, consider professional assessment.

## Key Concepts

- **Mobility vs. flexibility:** Usable range vs. passive range—mobility is the goal
- **Modern crisis:** Most adults have lost significant range
- **Key areas:** Hips, thoracic spine, shoulders, ankles
- **Approaches:** Stretching, active mobility, loaded stretching, flow
- **Consistency:** Daily practice, even brief, beats occasional long sessions

<Callout type="important">
Stretching shouldn't cause pain. Work at challenging but comfortable ranges. If mobility restrictions don't respond to consistent work, or if stretching causes pain, consider seeing a physical therapist or movement professional.
