## Breathing for Calm

When your nervous system is activated—stressed, anxious, overwhelmed—your breath is your fastest tool for regulation.

The key principle: **Extend the exhale.** Every technique in this module emphasizes the exhale, activating your parasympathetic nervous system.

---

## Technique 1: 4-7-8 Breathing

Developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, this is a powerful calming technique.

### How to Do It:
1. **Inhale** through nose for **4 counts**
2. **Hold** your breath for **7 counts**
3. **Exhale** through mouth for **8 counts**

### Why It Works:
- Extended exhale activates calm
- Breath hold allows CO2 buildup (calming)
- The counting occupies anxious mind
- Forces slow, controlled breathing

### When to Use:
- Before sleep
- During anxiety
- Before stressful events
- To break racing thoughts

---

## Technique 2: Box Breathing

Used by Navy SEALs for stress management. Equal counts create balance and control.

### How to Do It:
1. **Inhale** for 4 counts
2. **Hold** for 4 counts
3. **Exhale** for 4 counts
4. **Hold** for 4 counts
5. Repeat

### Visualization:
Imagine tracing a square—each side is one part of the breath.

### When to Use:
- High-pressure situations
- When you need focus + calm
- Before difficult conversations
- During acute stress

---

## Technique 3: Coherent Breathing

Breathing at approximately 5 breaths per minute creates optimal heart rate variability.

### How to Do It:
- Inhale for 5-6 counts
- Exhale for 5-6 counts
- No pauses
- Smooth, continuous

### Why It Works:
This rate synchronizes heart rate variability (HRV) with breathing, creating a coherent state that promotes:
- Emotional balance
- Mental clarity
- Stress resilience
- Cardiovascular health

### When to Use:
- Daily practice (5-20 minutes)
- Meditation foundation
- General stress reduction
- Building baseline calm

---

## Technique 4: Extended Exhale

The simplest calming technique—just make exhale longer than inhale.

### How to Do It:
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Exhale for 6-8 counts
- Repeat

### Variations:
- 3 in, 6 out
- 4 in, 8 out
- 5 in, 10 out

### When to Use:
- Anywhere, anytime
- During meetings or social situations
- When you can't do more elaborate techniques
- First-line intervention for stress

<Exercise title="Practice: Calming Techniques">

Try each technique for 2-3 minutes. Notice which ones resonate with you.

### 4-7-8 Breathing

Practice 4 cycles of 4-7-8 breathing now.

<Journal
  id="478-practice"
  prompt="After practicing 4-7-8 breathing, what do you notice? Rate your stress/calm on a 1-10 scale before and after."
  placeholder="Before: stress level ___/10&#10;&#10;After: stress level ___/10&#10;&#10;I noticed..."
  rows={5}
/>

### Box Breathing

Practice 6 cycles of box breathing (4-4-4-4).

<Journal
  id="box-practice"
  prompt="After box breathing, what do you notice? How does it compare to 4-7-8?"
  placeholder="I noticed...&#10;&#10;Compared to 4-7-8, this felt..."
  rows={5}
/>

### Coherent Breathing

Practice coherent breathing (5-6 count in, 5-6 count out) for 3 minutes.

<Journal
  id="coherent-practice"
  prompt="After coherent breathing, what do you notice? How does this sustained practice feel different?"
  placeholder="After 3 minutes, I notice...&#10;&#10;This longer practice felt..."
  rows={5}
/>

### Extended Exhale

Practice extended exhale (4 in, 8 out) for 2 minutes.

<Journal

  prompt="After extended exhale practice, what do you notice?"
  placeholder="I noticed..."
  rows={4}

## Technique 5: Left Nostril Breathing

In yoga traditions, left nostril activates the calming, cooling channel.

### How to Do It:
1. Use right thumb to close right nostril
2. Inhale slowly through left nostril
3. Exhale slowly through left nostril
4. Continue for 2-5 minutes

### When to Use:
- Before sleep
- When feeling overheated or agitated
- To cool down after activating practices
- Evening practice

---

## Breathing for Sleep

Sleep difficulties often relate to nervous system activation. Use these protocols:

### Pre-Sleep Sequence:
1. **5 minutes coherent breathing** (5-6 count in/out)
2. **3-4 cycles of 4-7-8 breathing**
3. **Gentle extended exhale** until sleep

### Key Principles:
- Start breath practice 20-30 minutes before desired sleep
- Keep room dark, devices away
- Combine with body relaxation
- Don't try too hard—let sleep come

### If You Wake at Night:
- Avoid looking at clock
- Do gentle extended exhale breathing
- Don't force—just keep exhale longer than inhale
- Body scan from feet to head

---

## Breathing for Anxiety

Anxiety involves overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Breath techniques directly counter this.

### Acute Anxiety Protocol:
1. **3 physiological sighs** (double inhale + long exhale)
2. **Box breathing** for 2-3 minutes
3. **Extended exhale** until calm

### Panic Attack Support:
When in panic, breathing can feel impossible. Try:
1. Ground through senses first (5 things you see, 4 you hear, etc.)
2. One breath at a time—don't try for patterns
3. Exhale through pursed lips, slow and long
4. Once somewhat stable, gentle extended exhale

### Daily Anxiety Prevention:
- Morning coherent breathing (5-10 minutes)
- Physiological sighs throughout day
- Evening calming practice before bed
- Build CO2 tolerance over time

## Common Mistakes

### Trying Too Hard
- Forced breathing creates tension
- Keep it gentle, not strained
- Let go of perfectionism

### Wrong Count for You
- Counts are guidelines, not rules
- Adjust to your lung capacity
- Should feel comfortable, not strained

### Only Practicing During Crisis
- Daily practice builds capacity
- Crisis mode is hardest time to practice
- Build the skill when calm

### Chest Breathing
- Remember diaphragm/belly focus
- Hand on belly to check
- Chest should move minimally

---

## Integration Tips

### Build a Habit:
- Same time each day
- Stack with existing habit (after morning coffee, before bed)
- Start small (2-3 minutes)
- Gradually increase

### Use Triggers:
- Red lights → 3 deep breaths
- Before meals → physiological sigh
- Phone rings → exhale before answering
- Transition moments → breath reset

### Track Your Practice:
- Note what you practiced
- How you felt before/after
- What situations triggered use
- What worked best

## Key Concepts

- **4-7-8 Breathing:** Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8. Powerful sleep and anxiety technique.

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll learn activating techniques—how to use breath to increase energy, focus, and motivation. Having both calming AND activating tools gives you full control over your state.

**Before moving on:**
- Practice each calming technique at least once
- Choose your "go-to" calming technique
- Use calming breath once daily for a week

*When you can calm yourself with breath, you're no longer at the mercy of your nervous system.*
