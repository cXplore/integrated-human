## The Sleep Saboteurs

You know sleep matters. You try to sleep. But something keeps interfering.

Understanding what disrupts sleep is essential for fixing it. Most sleep problems have identifiable causes—and solutions.

**The path to better sleep often starts with identifying what's getting in the way.**

---

## Light Exposure

### The Problem:
Light, especially blue light from screens, signals your brain that it's daytime. This suppresses melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep.

### How It Disrupts:
- Delayed sleep onset
- Reduced melatonin production
- Shifted circadian rhythm
- Less restorative sleep

### Sources:
- Phone, tablet, computer screens
- TV
- Bright overhead lights
- LED bulbs

### Solutions:
- No screens 1-2 hours before bed (ideal)
- If screens are necessary: blue light filters, night mode
- Dim lights in evening
- Blackout curtains for bedroom

---

## Caffeine

### The Problem:
Caffeine blocks adenosine, the sleep pressure chemical. It has a half-life of 5-6 hours—meaning half is still in your system hours later.

### How It Disrupts:
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Reduced deep sleep
- More fragmented sleep
- Earlier waking

### Timeline:
If you have coffee at 3pm, at 9pm you still have half the caffeine in your system.

### Solutions:
- No caffeine after noon (or earlier for sensitive people)
- Be aware of hidden caffeine: chocolate, some teas, some medications
- If you "need" coffee to function, you may be compensating for sleep debt

## Alcohol

### The Problem:
Alcohol is sedating but actually disrupts sleep quality significantly.

### How It Disrupts:
- Suppresses REM sleep
- Fragments sleep (more awakenings)
- Causes rebound wakefulness
- Dehydration
- More trips to bathroom

### The Paradox:
You may fall asleep faster but sleep much worse.

### Solutions:
- Limit evening alcohol
- No alcohol close to bedtime (at least 3 hours)
- Consider impact vs. benefit

---

## Irregular Schedule

### The Problem:
Your body clock thrives on regularity. Inconsistent sleep times confuse your circadian rhythm.

### How It Disrupts:
- Difficulty falling asleep at desired time
- Social jet lag (weekday vs. weekend schedules)
- Less restorative sleep
- Chronic fatigue

### Solutions:
- Consistent bedtime and wake time (even weekends)
- Maximum 1-hour variation
- Anchor wake time is most important

---

## Temperature

### The Problem:
Your body temperature drops for sleep. If your environment is too warm, this process is disrupted.

### Ideal Temperature:
65-68°F (18-20°C) for most people.

### Solutions:
- Cool bedroom
- Breathable bedding
- No heavy pajamas
- Consider cooling mattress pads if needed
- Hot bath before bed (counterintuitive, but helps: body temp drops after)

<Exercise title="Your Environment">

<Checklist
  id="sleep-environment"
  title="Check your sleep environment:"
  items={[
    "Room is dark (blackout curtains or eye mask)",
    "Room is cool (65-68°F/18-20°C)",
    "Room is quiet (or white noise if needed)",
    "Mattress and pillows are comfortable",
    "Bedroom is primarily for sleep (not work)",
    "Phone is away from bed (or on airplane mode)",
    "No TV in bedroom",
    "Minimal light from devices"

## Stress and Anxiety

### The Problem:
An activated nervous system cannot shift into sleep. Racing thoughts, worry, and stress keep you awake.

### How It Disrupts:
- Difficulty falling asleep (mind won't quiet)
- Waking with racing thoughts
- Non-restorative sleep
- Shallow sleep

### Solutions:
- Wind-down routine
- Worry journal (write worries before bed)
- Nervous system regulation practices (next module)
- Address underlying stress sources
- Consider therapy for anxiety

---

## Eating and Drinking

### The Problem:
Eating too close to bed can disrupt sleep. Blood sugar spikes and digestion interfere with rest.

### How It Disrupts:
- Acid reflux if lying down after eating
- Blood sugar fluctuations
- Body working on digestion rather than rest
- Disrupted sleep architecture

### Solutions:
- No large meals 2-3 hours before bed
- Light snack okay if hungry
- Limit fluids before bed (to reduce waking to urinate)

---

## Exercise

### The Problem (and Benefit):
Exercise generally improves sleep—but timing matters.

### How It Can Disrupt:
- Vigorous exercise too close to bed raises body temperature and activates nervous system

### Solutions:
- Exercise during the day (morning light exposure + exercise is ideal)
- If evening, finish 2-3 hours before bed
- Gentle yoga or stretching in evening is fine

---

## Napping

### The Problem:
Naps reduce sleep pressure, making nighttime sleep harder.

### When Napping Helps:
- Short power naps (10-20 min) early in day
- Sleep debt situations

### When Napping Hurts:
- Long naps (>30 min)
- Naps late in afternoon
- Chronic napping instead of addressing nighttime sleep

### Guidelines:
- If you nap: short, early afternoon
- If sleep at night is a problem: avoid naps

  prompt="Based on this module, what are your main sleep disruptors? Be honest about caffeine, alcohol, schedule, stress, and other factors."

## Sleep Disorders

### When It's Not Just Habits:

**Sleep Apnea:**
- Breathing stops during sleep
- Causes: snoring, gasping, daytime fatigue
- Requires medical evaluation

**Insomnia:**
- Chronic difficulty falling/staying asleep
- May need specialized treatment (CBT-I)

**Restless Leg Syndrome:**
- Urge to move legs at night
- Requires medical evaluation

### When to See a Doctor:
- Chronic sleep problems despite good habits
- Loud snoring or gasping
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Other concerning symptoms

---

## Key Concepts

- **Light:** Avoid blue light before bed; keep bedroom dark.

- **Caffeine:** No caffeine after noon.

- **Alcohol:** Disrupts sleep architecture despite sedation.

- **Schedule:** Consistency is key—same time every day.

- **Environment:** Cool, dark, quiet.

- **Stress:** Nervous system activation prevents sleep.

## What's Next

In Module 4, you'll learn how to optimize your sleep with evidence-based protocols.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify your personal sleep disruptors
- Consider which are easiest to address first
- Begin making one change this week

*Most sleep problems have identifiable causes. The solution isn't always sleeping pills—it's removing what's interfering with natural sleep. Address the disruptors, and sleep often improves naturally.*
