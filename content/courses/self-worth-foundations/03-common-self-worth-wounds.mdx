## The Wounds We Carry

Self-worth wounds show up in predictable patterns. Recognizing these patterns is crucial—you can't change what you can't see. This module explores common wounds and how they manifest, helping you identify what needs healing.

## The "Not Enough" Wound

### What It Is

The belief that you're fundamentally insufficient:
- Not smart enough
- Not attractive enough
- Not talented enough
- Not successful enough
- Just... not enough

### How It Shows Up

This wound creates:
- Constant striving and proving
- Never celebrating achievements
- Exhaustion from trying to be enough
- Comparison to everyone
- A finish line that keeps moving

### The Trap

No matter what you achieve:
- It's never enough
- There's always more to prove
- The goalpost moves
- You can't rest

## The Unlovable Wound

### What It Is

The belief that you're fundamentally unlovable:
- If people really knew you, they'd leave
- Something about you is unacceptable
- You have to hide your true self
- Love must be earned or won't last

### How It Shows Up

This wound creates:
- Fear of intimacy
- Hiding parts of yourself
- Testing relationships
- Clinging or pushing away
- Choosing unavailable partners

### The Paradox

The wound creates distance:
- You hide to protect yourself
- But hiding prevents real connection
- Which confirms you're unlovable
- The cycle continues

## The Invisible Wound

### What It Is

The belief that you don't matter:
- Your needs are unimportant
- You shouldn't take up space
- Others' needs come first
- Being seen is dangerous or wrong

### How It Shows Up

This wound creates:
- Putting everyone else first
- Not asking for what you need
- Shrinking to avoid attention
- Difficulty receiving
- Feeling invisible even in crowds

### The Pattern

You learned to disappear:
- Your needs weren't met
- So you stopped having them
- Or stopped expressing them
- And lost yourself in the process

## The Flawed Wound

### What It Is

The belief that something is fundamentally wrong with you:
- You're broken in some way
- Others are normal; you're defective
- If people knew the truth, they'd reject you
- You need to be fixed

### How It Shows Up

This wound creates:
- Shame about who you are
- Hiding perceived flaws
- Seeking to fix yourself constantly
- Never accepting yourself
- Feeling like an outsider

### The Shame

This wound carries deep shame:
- Not for what you did, but who you are
- A sense of being inherently bad
- Difficulty looking at yourself
- Fear of exposure

<Callout type="important">
These wounds aren't character flaws—they're adaptations to painful experiences. They made sense once. They were how you survived. But what protected you then may limit you now. Recognizing your wounds is not about judgment. It's about awareness. And awareness is the first step to healing. You can't address what you can't see.
