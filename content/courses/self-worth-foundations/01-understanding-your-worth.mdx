## The Foundation of Everything

Self-worth is the foundation upon which your entire life is built. It affects your relationships, your career, your boundaries, your dreams—everything. Yet most people have never examined what self-worth actually is or where theirs came from. This module begins that essential exploration.

## What Is Self-Worth?

### Defining Self-Worth

Self-worth is:
- Your internal sense of being valuable
- Your belief about whether you matter
- How you feel about yourself at your core
- Your sense of deserving good things

### What It's Not

Self-worth is different from:
- **Self-esteem:** How you evaluate your abilities
- **Self-confidence:** Belief in your capabilities
- **Achievements:** What you've accomplished
- **Approval:** What others think of you

### Why It Matters

Self-worth affects:
- What you believe you deserve
- How you let others treat you
- What you pursue or avoid
- Your capacity for joy and fulfillment
- Every relationship you have

## Conditional vs. Unconditional Worth

### Conditional Worth

Many of us learned worth is conditional:
- "I'm valuable when I achieve"
- "I'm worthy when I'm helpful"
- "I matter when I'm approved of"
- "I'm enough when I'm perfect"

### The Problem

Conditional worth means:
- Constant proving and performing
- Never feeling secure
- Worth fluctuating with circumstances
- Exhaustion from trying to earn value

### Unconditional Worth

The truth:
- You have worth simply because you exist
- It can't be earned or lost
- It doesn't depend on performance
- It's your birthright

<Callout type="important">
Your worth isn't something you have to earn, prove, or maintain. It's not determined by what you do, what you achieve, or what others think. You have worth simply because you exist. The journey isn't about creating worth—it's about uncovering the worth that was always there, buried under messages and experiences that told you otherwise.
</Callout>

*Your worth is not up for debate. It's your birthright.*
