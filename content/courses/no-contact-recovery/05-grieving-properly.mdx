## The Only Way Out Is Through

You cannot think your way through grief. You cannot positive-mindset it away. You cannot numb it indefinitely.

The only way to process grief is to feel it.

This isn't about wallowing. It's about completion. Unfelt grief doesn't disappear—it goes underground and surfaces later, often in ways that are harder to understand and heal.

## What Grief Actually Is

Grief is the process of reorganizing yourself around an absence.

**You're grieving:**
- The person as you knew them
- Your role as their partner
- The routines and rhythms you shared
- The future you imagined
- The identity you had within the relationship
- The sense of being chosen

Each of these needs to be felt and released. It takes time. There's no shortcut.

## The Waves of Grief

Grief doesn't move in a straight line. It comes in waves.

**Pattern of the waves:**
- Early on: waves are constant and overwhelming
- Middle: waves are less frequent but still intense
- Later: waves are occasional and more manageable
- Eventually: waves are rare, and you can ride them with ease

**Triggers that bring waves:**
- Songs, places, smells
- Anniversaries and holidays
- Seeing them or hearing about them
- Certain times of day
- Seeing couples
- Being alone
- Being in crowds

You can't always predict what will trigger a wave. That's okay. When it comes, you ride it.

## How to Grieve Well

### 1. Make Space for It
You need designated time to feel. If you're constantly pushing grief away because you "have to function," it accumulates.

Schedule grief time:
- 20 minutes in the evening to journal and feel
- A weekly therapy session
- Sunday afternoons to just be sad
- A monthly ritual of some kind

Outside of this time, you can compartmentalize if needed. But the grief time is sacred.

### 2. Feel It in Your Body
Grief isn't just thoughts—it's physical.

- Where do you feel it? Chest? Throat? Stomach?
- What sensations are present? Heavy? Tight? Hollow?
- What movement wants to happen? Crying? Curling up? Screaming?

Let the body do what it needs to do. Grief that's expressed moves through faster.

### 3. Express It
Get it out of your body and into the world somehow:
- Crying (don't hold back)
- Writing (letters, journals, poetry)
- Art or music
- Movement and exercise
- Talking to someone who can just listen
- Screaming (in your car, into a pillow)

Unexpressed grief gets stuck. Expressed grief moves.

### 4. Be Witnessed
Grief is meant to be witnessed by others. There's something healing about someone simply being with you in your pain—not fixing it, not advising, just being present.

Find at least one person who can do this. A friend, therapist, support group. Let them see you grieve.

## What Gets in the Way

**"I should be over this by now."**
Says who? Grief takes as long as it takes. Comparing yourself to imaginary timelines just adds suffering.

**"I don't want to burden people."**
Real friends want to be there for you. Let them. You'd do the same for them.

**"If I start crying, I'll never stop."**
You will. Tears have a natural end point. What doesn't end naturally is suppressed grief.

**"It hurts too much."**
Yes. And the only way to hurt less is to let yourself hurt now. Avoided pain doesn't decrease—it waits.

**"I need to be strong."**
Feeling your feelings IS strength. Avoiding them is avoidance, not strength.

<Exercise title="Grief Practice">

This is a guided experience. Do it when you have privacy and time.

### Part 1: Creating Space

<Journal
  id="grief-space"
  prompt="When and where will you allow yourself to grieve?

• What time(s) of day can you dedicate to feeling?
• What physical space feels safe for this?
• What do you need to set up? (tissues, blanket, music)
• Who can witness your grief if you need them?

Create a grief practice, even if it's just 15 minutes a day."
  placeholder="My grief practice:&#10;&#10;When: &#10;&#10;Where: &#10;&#10;What I'll have with me: &#10;&#10;Who I can call if I need witnessing: &#10;"
  rows={12}
/>

### Part 2: What You're Grieving

<Journal
  id="what-grieving"
  prompt="Get specific about what you've lost. Each of these deserves to be felt.

• The person as they were in your best moments
• The routines you shared
• The future you imagined
• The role you played (partner, companion, lover)
• The identity you had with them
• What else?

Write each one, and notice what feeling comes up."
  placeholder="I'm grieving:&#10;&#10;1. &#10;   What I feel: &#10;&#10;2. &#10;   What I feel: &#10;&#10;3. &#10;   What I feel: &#10;&#10;4. &#10;   What I feel: &#10;&#10;5. &#10;   What I feel: "
  rows={18}
/>

### Part 3: A Letter of Goodbye

<Journal
  id="grief-goodbye"
  prompt="Write a goodbye letter. Not to send—just for you.

Say everything you need to say to fully release this relationship:
• What you'll miss
• What you're grateful for
• What you're angry about
• What you wish had been different
• Your final goodbye

Let this be a ritual of completion."
  placeholder="Dear [their name],

[Write your goodbye. Take your time. Let it all out. This is for closure that comes from within you, not from them.]"
  rows={20}
/>

<Callout type="insight">
Goodbye doesn't mean they meant nothing. It means you're choosing to release your grip on something that isn't yours to hold anymore.
</Callout>

</Exercise>

## Grief Rituals

Sometimes you need a physical action to mark the completion.

**Ideas:**
- Burn the letters (safely, symbolically)
- Return or donate their things
- Rearrange your living space
- Get a haircut or change your appearance
- Take a solo trip somewhere new
- Write a letter and bury it
- Create a ceremony with a close friend

Find something that feels meaningful to you. Grief needs rituals.

## Signs of Healthy Grieving

You're doing it well if:
- You're feeling worse before feeling better (initially)
- The waves are intense but they pass
- You're able to function between waves
- The good memories don't hurt quite as much over time
- You're starting to see the relationship more clearly
- You're having occasional moments of lightness
- You're not numbing constantly

---

## Key Concepts

- **The only way out is through.** Avoided grief doesn't disappear—it waits.

- **Grief comes in waves.** They become less frequent and less intense over time.

- **Expression moves grief.** Get it out of your body through tears, words, movement.

- **Be witnessed.** Grief is meant to be seen by caring others.

## What's Next

In Module 6, we'll turn toward rebuilding—who are you outside of this relationship? How do you become someone who is whole on their own?

*Let yourself feel this. All of it. That's how you get to the other side.*
