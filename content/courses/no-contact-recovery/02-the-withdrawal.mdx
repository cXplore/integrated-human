## This Is a Detox

The pain you're feeling isn't weakness. It's not a sign you made a mistake. It's withdrawal.

Your nervous system was wired into another person. Your brain chemistry was shaped by their presence. Now that connection is gone, and your entire system is in protest.

Understanding this doesn't make it hurt less. But it helps you stop adding suffering on top of pain.

## What Withdrawal Actually Feels Like

Everyone's experience is different, but these are common:

**Physical symptoms:**
- Chest pain or tightness
- Nausea and loss of appetite
- Exhaustion but inability to sleep
- Physical ache that has no location
- Immune system suppression (getting sick easily)
- Feeling like you're going crazy

**Mental symptoms:**
- Obsessive thoughts about them
- Replaying conversations and scenarios
- Difficulty concentrating on anything else
- Memory and focus problems
- Racing or catastrophic thoughts

**Emotional symptoms:**
- Waves of intense grief
- Anger that comes from nowhere
- Desperation and panic
- Numbness and emptiness
- Shame about how much you're struggling

**The waves:**
It's not constant. It comes in waves. You'll feel okay, then suddenly feel like you're drowning. This is normal. The waves get further apart over time.

## The Timeline of Healing

This isn't exact, but it helps to know what's coming:

### Days 1-7: Acute Phase
- Constant thoughts about them
- Physical symptoms at their worst
- Strong urge to reach out
- Sleep is severely disrupted
- You may feel like you're dying

**Survival focus:** Just get through each hour. Don't make any big decisions.

### Days 8-14: Still Intense
- Urges remain strong
- Some moments of relief
- Anger may start emerging
- Energy is very low
- First glimpses of clarity

**Survival focus:** Keep your no-contact commitment. Lean on support.

### Weeks 3-4: Stabilization Begins
- Longer periods between waves
- Sleep improving
- Appetite returning
- Starting to function again
- Can think about other things sometimes

**Growth focus:** Begin processing what happened. Journal regularly.

### Weeks 5-8: Finding Ground
- Identity starting to rebuild
- Less obsessive thinking
- Perspective returning
- Energy for life coming back
- Still tender, but healing

**Growth focus:** Reconnect with yourself, your interests, your people.

### Months 3-6: Integration
- They're less present in your mind
- Can think about the relationship more clearly
- Lessons becoming visible
- Ready for new connections (maybe)
- Still tender on some days

## How to Survive the Waves

When a wave hits:

### 1. Name It
"This is a wave. It will pass. It always passes."

### 2. Feel It in Your Body
Where is the pain located? Put your hand there. Breathe into it. Don't try to make it go away—just be with it.

### 3. Don't Add Stories
The pain is the pain. Don't add stories about what it means, what you should have done, or what will happen next. Just feel the raw sensation.

### 4. Move Your Body
Walk. Run. Dance. Shake. Scream into a pillow. The emotion is energy—it needs to move.

### 5. Wait
The wave will peak and then recede. Time it if you need to. Most intense waves last 20-90 minutes.

## The Urge to Numb

You will want to not feel this. That's understandable—this hurts.

Common numbing strategies:
- Alcohol or substances
- Obsessive social media scrolling
- Jumping into a new relationship (rebound)
- Overworking
- Oversleeping
- Overeating or undereating
- Excessive exercise
- Constant distraction

**The problem:** Numbing delays healing. The pain has to be felt to be processed. Anything you don't feel now, you'll feel later—often in ways that are harder to understand.

**A middle path:** You don't have to feel everything all at once. It's okay to take breaks. Watch a movie. See a friend. Get some relief. But don't make numbing your primary strategy.

<Exercise title="Mapping Your Withdrawal">

Understanding your specific experience helps you work with it.

### Part 1: Your Symptoms

### Part 3: Your Survival Kit

<Journal

Every wave you survive without reaching out builds your capacity. You're not just getting through this—you're becoming someone who can handle hard things.

## What Makes It Worse

Avoid these during withdrawal:

**Relationship autopsies:** Endlessly analyzing what went wrong. Not now. Later.

**Social media stalking:** Even if you haven't blocked them. Every look sets you back.

**Mutual friends updates:** Tell them you don't want to know. You can re-engage later.

**Alcohol/substances:** Loosens your inhibitions and increases likelihood of reaching out.

**Too much alone time:** Isolation amplifies everything.

**Major decisions:** Your judgment is impaired. Don't quit your job, move cities, or make big choices.

**Dating apps:** Your system isn't ready. You'll either attract unhealthy dynamics or use people as bandages.

## What Actually Helps

**Physical care:**
- Sleep as much as you need
- Eat, even when you don't want to
- Move your body daily
- Go outside and get sunlight
- Limit alcohol and caffeine

**Emotional care:**
- Cry when you need to
- Talk to people who can just listen
- Journal to get thoughts out of your head
- Feel the feelings rather than fighting them

**Mental care:**
- Limit rumination actively
- Distract when needed (it's okay)
- Be gentle with your concentration
- Avoid major decisions

**Spiritual care:**
- Whatever gives you a sense of something larger
- Nature, meditation, prayer, community
- Remember: this too shall pass

---

## Key Concepts

- **This is withdrawal, not weakness.** Your brain is in chemical distress. Treat yourself accordingly.

- **It comes in waves.** And waves pass. They always pass.

- **Feel, don't numb.** What you don't feel now, you'll feel later—worse and more confused.

- **Lower the bar.** You just need to survive right now. That's enough.

## What's Next

In Module 3, we'll deal with the specific challenge of wanting to reach out—what's actually driving that urge, and what to do when it becomes overwhelming.

For now, just focus on getting through today. Then tomorrow.

*You're doing something incredibly hard. And you're doing it.*
