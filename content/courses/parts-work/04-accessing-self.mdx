## What Is Self?

In the IFS model, Self isn't another part. It's the core of who you are—the essence that exists underneath all parts.

**Self is characterized by:**
- **Curiosity** — Genuinely interested in understanding
- **Compassion** — Caring without agenda
- **Calm** — Present and grounded
- **Confidence** — Not arrogance, but quiet assurance
- **Clarity** — Seeing clearly without distortion
- **Creativity** — Finding new ways forward
- **Courage** — Able to face what needs facing
- **Connectedness** — Sense of connection to something larger

**The 8 C's:** These qualities are Self's natural expression when parts step back.

## Self vs. Parts

**Parts** have agendas, fears, and extreme reactions. They're trying to protect or cope.

**Self** is curious, open, and non-reactive. It can hold all parts with compassion.

### How to Tell the Difference

**You're in a part if you feel:**
- Urgency
- Judgment (toward self or others)
- Fear driving behavior
- Strong agenda
- Emotional flooding or reactivity
- Numbness or avoidance
- Extreme positions

**You're in Self if you feel:**
- Curiosity without agenda
- Compassion for all involved
- Calm even in difficulty
- Openness to what's here
- Spaciousness
- Connected
- Centered

### The Question

When working with parts, the question is always:
**"Am I in Self, or am I in a part?"**

If a part is reacting TO another part, you can't work effectively. You need Self to mediate.

---

## Why Self Matters

**Self is the healer.** Parts can't heal other parts—they're too biased, too invested. Self can hold all parts with equanimity and facilitate healing.

**Self is the leader.** Without Self leading, parts run the show. Often they conflict, creating internal chaos.

**Self builds trust.** Protectors need to trust that someone competent will handle things if they step back. That someone is Self.

**Self does the exile work.** When you approach wounded exiles, you need to come from Self, not from a part that might overwhelm, judge, or recoil.

---

## Accessing Self

Self is always there—it's just often obscured by parts. Accessing Self means creating space for it.

### Method 1: Ask Parts to Step Back

**The direct request:**
"I'd like to ask all my parts to step back a bit so I can be present."

Parts often respond to this request, especially if they've learned to trust Self.

**If parts won't step back:**
- Negotiate with them
- Offer reassurance they won't be abandoned
- Ask what they need to feel safe stepping back
- Work with them individually first (Module 3)

### Method 2: Notice and Separate

**When you notice a part is active:**
1. Name it: "That's my Anxious Part"
2. Create space: "I'm noticing you, but I'm not you"
3. Find where YOU are observing the part
4. Rest in the observer position

**The observer is Self.** The one who can notice parts is not itself a part.

### Method 3: Through the Body

Self energy is felt in the body as:
- Groundedness
- Spaciousness
- Centered presence
- Often felt in the chest or core

**Practice:**
1. Settle into your body
2. Feel your feet, your seat, your breath
3. Notice any activation (parts)
4. Let it be there without being captured by it
5. Feel for what's underneath—the ground of awareness

### Method 4: The Qualities Doorway

**Use Self qualities as doorways:**

Pick one quality (curiosity, compassion, calm, etc.) and cultivate it toward a part.

If you can feel curious toward a part, you're in Self.
If you're judging the part, a part is active.

The qualities ARE Self expressing. Cultivating them brings you there.

## Self-Led vs. Part-Led

Notice the difference:

### Part-Led Response to Anger

"This anger is bad. I shouldn't feel this. I need to get rid of it."
(A part is judging the anger)

### Self-Led Response to Anger

"There's anger here. I'm curious about it. What's this part trying to protect?"
(Self is curious about the anger)

### Part-Led Response to Anxiety

"I need to fix this. I can't handle this. Make it stop."
(A part is reactive to the anxiety)

### Self-Led Response to Anxiety

"I notice anxiety is here. It's uncomfortable and it's okay. What does this part need?"
(Self is present with the anxiety)

## Blocks to Self-Access

Sometimes Self seems inaccessible. This is usually because:

### Parts Are Afraid

Parts don't trust Self to lead. They've been running things so long, they think they're essential.

**What helps:** Building trust over time. Proving Self can handle things.

### Trauma Is Unprocessed

Severe trauma can make Self-access difficult. The system is too threatened.

**What helps:** Professional support. Slow, safe processing.

### Parts Are Blended

You're so merged with parts that you don't realize there's anything else.

**What helps:** Practice noticing. "Who is noticing this thought/feeling?" That noticer is Self.

### Habit

You've never accessed Self consciously. It's not a familiar state.

**What helps:** Practice. Regular meditation or inner work builds Self-access.

## Self-Energy Practice

A practice for cultivating Self-access:

### Settling (2-3 minutes)

Sit comfortably. Feel your body. Take a few deep breaths.

### Noticing Parts (2-3 minutes)

What parts are present right now? Name them. Notice without judging.

"There's some anxiety... there's the Planner wanting to fix something... there's the Critic..."

### Asking Parts to Step Back (2-3 minutes)

"I appreciate you all. Would you be willing to step back for a few minutes so I can be present?"

Notice if there's any shift. If parts won't step back, just notice them from a bit of distance.

### Resting in Self (5-10 minutes)

What's here when parts step back, even slightly?

Notice:
- Any sense of spaciousness
- Any quality of presence
- The ground of awareness underneath thoughts and feelings

This might feel like:
- Open
- Quiet
- Still
- Curious
- Present
- Calm

Just rest here. You don't have to do anything.

### Returning (1-2 minutes)

When ready, thank your parts for stepping back. Let them return to normal.

Take a few breaths. Feel your body. Open your eyes.

## Exercise: Self-Access Assessment

### Part 1: Current State

**How much access do I have to Self qualities?**

Rate yourself 1-10 on each (1 = rarely/never, 10 = consistently):

- Curiosity (toward myself and others): __/10
- Compassion (toward myself and others): __/10
- Calm (even in difficulty): __/10
- Confidence (quiet assurance): __/10
- Clarity (seeing clearly): __/10
- Creativity (finding new ways): __/10
- Courage (facing what needs facing): __/10
- Connectedness (to self, others, something larger): __/10

### Part 2: Blocks

**What blocks my Self-access?**

Parts that take over:

Situations that pull me out of Self:

Beliefs about Self-access:

### Part 3: Practice

**Try the Self-Energy Practice above.**

**What happened when you asked parts to step back?**

**What was present when there was more space?**

**What did Self feel like in your body?**

## Self in Daily Life

You don't have to be in Self 100% of the time. Parts will activate. That's normal.

**The practice is:**
1. Notice when a part takes over
2. Remember: "I am not this part. I have this part."
3. Find the space where Self can observe
4. Lead from Self when possible

**Over time:**
- Self-access becomes more available
- Parts learn to trust Self more
- You spend more time Self-led
- Parts relax their extreme roles

---

## Key Concepts

- **Self:** The core presence characterized by the 8 C's—curiosity, compassion, calm, confidence, clarity, creativity, courage, connectedness.

- **Self vs. Parts:** Parts have agendas and reactivity. Self has openness and presence.

- **Accessing Self:** Ask parts to step back, notice and separate from parts, come through the body, use Self qualities as doorways.

- **Self-Led:** When Self leads, there's curiosity and compassion toward all parts. When parts lead, there's reactivity and judgment.

## What's Next

Module 5 guides you into working with wounded exiles—the parts carrying pain that the protectors protect. This work requires Self-access, which is why we established it here.

Practice Self-access this week. The more available Self is, the more powerful your parts work becomes.

*You are not your parts. You have parts. The one who knows this—that's Self.*
