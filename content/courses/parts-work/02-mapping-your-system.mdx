## Getting to Know Your Parts

You've begun noticing parts in Module 1. Now we go deeper—systematically identifying, naming, and understanding your internal family.

This mapping is ongoing work. You don't need to identify everything at once. Parts reveal themselves when they're ready.

## How to Identify Parts

### Through Conflict

When you feel conflicted, there are parts in tension.

**"I want to X, but I also want to Y"**
- The part that wants X
- The part that wants Y

**"I know I should X, but I can't seem to do it"**
- The part that "knows" (often a manager)
- The part that resists (might be protecting something)

**"Part of me feels X, another feels Y"**
- Two emotional parts with different responses

### Through Reaction

Strong reactions point to parts.

**When you get triggered:**
- What part is reacting?
- What is it protecting?

**When you numb out:**
- What firefighter part is activating?
- What exile is it protecting against?

**When you get rigid:**
- What manager part is trying to maintain control?

### Through Patterns

Recurring patterns point to parts running the show.

- Always people-pleasing? A part is driving that.
- Always perfectionist? There's a part.
- Always avoiding? A part is protecting something.

### Through Body

Parts live in the body too.

- Chronic tension somewhere? A part might be holding there.
- Sudden physical shifts? A part might be activating.
- Numbness or disconnection? A part might be protecting.

## Naming Your Parts

Give each part a name. This creates differentiation—you are not the part; the part is part of you.

### Naming Options

**Descriptive names:**
- The Perfectionist
- The Anxious One
- The Angry Part
- The Little One

**Feeling-based names:**
- Fear
- Shame
- The Sad Part
- Rage

**Age-based names:**
- Five-Year-Old Me
- Teenage Me
- The Young One

**Personal names:**
- Whatever feels right
- Names can change as you get to know parts better

### Example Part Names

**Managers:**
- The Achiever
- The Good Girl/Boy
- The Controller
- The Planner
- The Inner Critic
- The Caretaker
- The Judge

**Firefighters:**
- The Escaper
- The Numb One
- The Binger
- The Rager
- The Shutdown Part

**Exiles:**
- The Lonely Child
- The Shamed One
- The Abandoned One
- The Unlovable Part
- Little Me

## Learning About Each Part

Once you've identified a part, get curious about it:

### Key Questions

**What does this part do?**
Its role, its job, its function.

**What is it trying to protect me from?**
All parts are protective in some way.

**How old is this part?**
When did it form? What age does it feel?

**What does it feel? What does it believe?**
Its emotions and beliefs about you, others, the world.

**What does it want?**
Usually safety, love, acceptance, protection.

**What does it need to hear/receive?**
What would help this part relax?

### Example: Meeting the Inner Critic

**What does it do?**
Criticizes me, points out flaws, predicts failure.

**What is it protecting me from?**
Rejection, humiliation, being caught off guard by criticism.

**How old is it?**
Formed around age 7 when I started getting criticized for mistakes.

**What does it believe?**
That I'm not good enough. That if it doesn't criticize me first, someone else will.

**What does it want?**
To keep me safe from rejection.

**What does it need?**
To know that I can handle criticism. That it doesn't have to work so hard.

## Parts Mapping Exercise

### Part 1: Identify Your Managers

These are proactive protectors. They run things.

**Manager Part 1:**
- Name:
- What it does:
- What it protects against:
- When it shows up:
- How it feels in body:

**Manager Part 2:**
- Name:
- What it does:
- What it protects against:
- When it shows up:
- How it feels in body:

**Manager Part 3:**
- Name:
- What it does:
- What it protects against:
- When it shows up:
- How it feels in body:

### Part 2: Identify Your Firefighters

These are reactive protectors. They jump in during emergencies.

**Firefighter Part 1:**
- Name:
- What it does (how it numbs/escapes/reacts):
- What triggers it:
- What exile pain is it protecting against:
- How it feels in body:

**Firefighter Part 2:**
- Name:
- What it does:
- What triggers it:
- What it's protecting against:
- How it feels in body:

### Part 3: Identify Your Exiles

These are the wounded parts. The ones carrying pain.

**Exile Part 1:**
- Name:
- What it carries (pain, shame, fear, etc.):
- How old it feels:
- What happened to create this part:
- Where it lives in body:

**Exile Part 2:**
- Name:
- What it carries:
- How old it feels:
- What happened:
- Where in body:

### Part 4: Map the System

**Draw your system:**

You can create a visual map showing:
- Which parts are connected
- Which parts are protecting which exiles
- Which parts are in conflict with each other

Or simply list relationships:

**"[Manager] is protecting against [Exile]"**

**"[Firefighter] activates when [Exile] starts to surface"**

**"[Part A] and [Part B] are in conflict about..."**

---

## Common Part Relationships

### Typical Protector-Exile Relationships

**Perfectionist → Shamed Child**
The Perfectionist works hard so the Shamed Child never has to feel that shame again.

**People-Pleaser → Abandoned Child**
The People-Pleaser keeps everyone happy so the Abandoned Child won't be left.

**Numbing Part → Grief**
The Numbing Part prevents feeling so the Grief doesn't surface.

**Inner Critic → Worthless Part**
The Inner Critic attacks first so the Worthless Part is protected from others' criticism.

### Typical Part Conflicts

**Achiever vs. Rest-Wanting Part**
One pushes productivity, one wants relaxation. Neither trusts the other.

**Control Part vs. Spontaneous Part**
One needs structure, one needs freedom. Constant tension.

**Caretaker vs. Needs-Having Part**
One focuses on others, one has unmet needs. The Caretaker often wins.

## Parts and Shadow Work

Parts work and shadow work overlap significantly:

**Shadow** = Exiled parts + rejected protector parts

Parts that have been pushed out of awareness become shadow. Working with parts is one way to integrate shadow.

**The Inner Critic might be a shadow part:**
- If you reject your judgmental side
- If you deny you have a critical part
- It becomes shadow

**Key insight:** Even the parts you don't like are parts. They need integration, not elimination.

---

## Working with Resistance

As you map your system, you may notice:
- Resistance to exploring certain parts
- Fog or blankness when trying to access some areas
- Strong reactions to certain exercises

**This is protective parts doing their job.** They're not sure it's safe to explore.

**What to do:**
- Thank the protective part for its concern
- Go slowly
- Don't force
- Build trust over time
- Consider professional support for intense material

## Exercise: Getting to Know One Part

Choose one part to get to know better.

### Part Selection
**The part I want to know better:**

**Why this part:** (What draws you to explore it?)

### Deep Inquiry

**What does this part look like?**
(Age, appearance, energy, presence)

**What does this part believe about me?**

**What does this part believe about the world?**

**What is this part's biggest fear?**

**What is this part's deepest need?**

**When did this part form? What happened?**

**What would this part say if it could speak freely?**

**What does this part want me to know?**

### Dialogue

Write a brief dialogue with this part:

**Me:**

**Part:**

**Me:**

**Part:**

## Key Concepts

- **Parts Mapping:** Systematically identifying and understanding your internal parts.

- **Naming:** Giving parts names creates differentiation and makes them workable.

- **All Parts Are Protective:** Understanding what each part protects helps compassion arise.

- **Relationships:** Parts relate to each other—protectors protect exiles, parts conflict with each other.

- **Ongoing Process:** Mapping continues as parts reveal themselves over time.

---

## What's Next

Module 3 focuses specifically on protector parts—the managers and firefighters that run so much of the show. Learning to work with them skillfully is essential before deeper exile work.

Continue noticing and mapping your parts. The more you know your system, the more skillfully you can work with it.

*Knowing your parts is the beginning of internal freedom. What was unconscious becomes conscious. What drove you blindly becomes something you can work with.*
