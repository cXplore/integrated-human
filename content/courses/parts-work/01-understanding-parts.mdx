## You Are Not One Thing

Have you ever noticed:
- Part of you wants to stay in bed, another wants to be productive
- Part of you craves connection, another wants to isolate
- Part of you is confident, another is terrified
- Part of you wants change, another sabotages it

This isn't dysfunction. This is how the psyche works.

**You are not a single, unified self. You're a system of parts.**

## The Parts Model

Various psychological traditions have noticed this multiplicity:
- Jungian psychology (complexes)
- Gestalt therapy (parts)
- Voice Dialogue
- Internal Family Systems (IFS)
- Ego State therapy

The most developed modern model is Internal Family Systems (IFS), created by Richard Schwartz. This course draws primarily from IFS concepts.

### Core Ideas

**1. We all have parts**
Not just "troubled" people. Everyone has multiple sub-personalities or parts.

**2. Parts have good intentions**
Even the most destructive parts are trying to help, usually protect, in their own way.

**3. Parts get stuck**
They take on roles (often in childhood) and keep playing them even when no longer needed.

**4. Parts can be updated**
With the right approach, parts can release old roles and burdens.

**5. There's a core Self**
Underneath all parts is a "Self" — the natural leader of the internal system.

## Types of Parts

IFS identifies three main categories:

### Exiles

The wounded parts. They carry:
- Pain from past experiences
- Shame, fear, worthlessness
- Young, vulnerable emotions
- What the psyche has pushed away

**Why "exile"?** Other parts exile them—push them out of awareness—because their pain feels unbearable or dangerous.

**What they need:** To be witnessed, validated, and unburdened.

### Managers

Proactive protective parts. They try to:
- Keep you functioning
- Prevent the exiles' pain from surfacing
- Maintain control
- Keep you safe through strategy

**Common manager parts:**
- The Perfectionist (if I'm perfect, I won't be rejected)
- The People-Pleaser (if I keep others happy, I'll be safe)
- The Controller (if I control everything, nothing can hurt me)
- The Critic (if I criticize first, others can't)
- The Planner (if I plan everything, I won't be caught off guard)

**What they need:** Appreciation for their protection, reassurance they won't be fired, trust that Self can lead.

### Firefighters

Reactive protective parts. When exile pain starts to emerge, firefighters jump into action:
- Put out the fire of overwhelming emotion
- Through whatever means necessary
- Often impulsive, sometimes destructive

**Common firefighter parts:**
- The Numbing part (substances, screens, food)
- The Rage part (explosion to overpower the pain)
- The Dissociator (just leave the body)
- The Self-Harm part (physical pain to escape emotional pain)
- The Binging part (food, shopping, etc.)

**What they need:** Same as managers—appreciation, reassurance, trust.

## How the System Works

Imagine your psyche as an internal family:

**Exiles** are the wounded children. They carry old pain and want attention, healing, and love.

**Managers** are the responsible adults. They run the show, keep things functional, and try to keep the wounded children out of sight.

**Firefighters** are emergency responders. When the wounded children threaten to overwhelm the system, firefighters do whatever it takes to shut it down.

### The Conflict

The system is trying to protect you. But the protection often causes problems:
- Managers create rigidity, anxiety, control issues
- Firefighters create addiction, impulsivity, destructive behavior
- Exiles, unfelt, run the show from underground

**The solution isn't to get rid of parts.** It's to update the system.

## Why Parts Develop

Parts typically form in childhood in response to:

### Wounding Events
- Trauma (big T and little t)
- Neglect
- Attachment failures
- Shame experiences
- Loss

When these happen, a part forms to carry the pain (exile) and other parts form to protect against it (managers, firefighters).

### Adaptive Roles
- "Be the good child" → People-Pleaser part
- "Don't have needs" → Self-Sufficient part
- "Perform to be loved" → Perfectionist part
- "Stay invisible" → Hiding part

These roles helped you survive. The parts still play them.

### Family System Roles
- The caretaker
- The scapegoat
- The peacemaker
- The achiever

Parts form to fulfill family functions.

## Parts Aren't Pathology

**The parts model is not about pathology.** Everyone has parts. It's the normal architecture of the psyche.

**What varies:**
- How extreme the parts are (related to how extreme the wounding was)
- How much the system is in conflict
- How much access to Self there is
- How polarized different parts are

**Even "problem" parts are trying to help.** The raging part is trying to protect you. The numbing part is trying to help you survive. The critical part thinks it's keeping you safe.

This doesn't mean their strategies are good. It means approaching them with curiosity and appreciation works better than fighting them.

## Meeting Parts

Parts can be experienced as:
- **Voices** — Internal dialogue, thoughts that seem to come from "someone"
- **Feelings** — Emotions that feel like they belong to a part
- **Body sensations** — Physical feelings associated with a part
- **Urges** — Impulses to act in certain ways
- **Images** — Visual representations of parts
- **Felt sense** — A gestalt feeling of a part's presence

### Example: Meeting a Critic Part

**As voice:** "You're not good enough. Who do you think you are?"

**As feeling:** Shame, smallness, pressure

**As body sensation:** Tightness in chest, constriction in throat

**As urge:** To shrink, to try harder, to give up

**As image:** Might appear as a stern figure, a parent, a teacher

**As felt sense:** A heavy, judgmental presence

## Exercise: Beginning Parts Awareness

This week, start noticing parts in your daily experience.

### Part 1: Parts Observation

Over the next few days, notice when different "voices" or impulses arise:

**"A part of me wants... while another part wants..."**

**Examples:**
- "Part of me wants to go out, part wants to stay home"
- "Part of me is angry, part is scared of being angry"
- "Part of me knows I should do X, part resists"

**Write down 5 observations of competing parts:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Part 2: Identify Common Parts

What parts do you notice showing up regularly?

**Parts that try to control/manage:** (perfectionist, planner, critic, etc.)

**Parts that react/put out fires:** (numbing, raging, escaping, etc.)

**Younger/vulnerable parts:** (scared, sad, ashamed, etc.)

### Part 3: Initial Map

**Draw or list your parts:**

Name any parts you've become aware of. You don't need to know them fully—just begin naming them.

## Key Concepts

- **Multiplicity:** The psyche is composed of many parts, not a single unified self.

- **Exiles:** Wounded parts carrying pain, often pushed out of awareness.

- **Managers:** Proactive protectors trying to prevent pain from surfacing.

- **Firefighters:** Reactive protectors that jump in when pain threatens to overwhelm.

- **All Parts Have Good Intentions:** Even destructive parts are trying to protect.

- **Self:** The core that can lead the system when parts step back.

## What's Next

Module 2 guides you through systematically mapping your internal system—identifying and understanding your specific parts in more depth.

For now, just notice. When you feel conflicted, name the parts. When you react, wonder what part is driving. Awareness is the first step.

*You're not broken for having conflicting parts. You're human. The path isn't eliminating parts—it's helping them work together.*
