## The Weight of Influence

When someone comes to you for guidance, a power dynamic is created.

They're vulnerable—seeking help, hoping you have answers. You're elevated—seen as having something they lack.

This dynamic creates responsibility. People can be harmed by guides who don't understand or respect this.

---

## The Power Dynamic

Power in guidance relationships:

**What they give you:**
- Trust
- Vulnerability
- Sometimes money
- Projection (you may become "the wise one")

**What you have:**
- Perceived authority
- Influence over their decisions
- Access to their inner world
- Their hope

This power can help or harm. Ethics ensure it helps.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Do No Harm
Your primary obligation. When in doubt, don't act. When uncertain, refer out. Never use your position to harm.

### 2. Informed Consent
Be clear about what you offer and what you don't. Don't claim expertise you don't have. Let them choose.

### 3. Confidentiality
What they share stays private. Exceptions: danger to self or others, and your own consultation/supervision.

### 4. Boundaries
Know where your role ends. You're not their friend, partner, or savior. Keep the relationship clear.

### 5. Competence
Only work within your competence. Know your limits. Refer out when something is beyond you.

## What You're Not

Be clear about what you're not offering:

**If you're not a licensed therapist:**
- You can't treat mental illness
- You can't diagnose
- You should refer when you see serious pathology

**If you're not a doctor:**
- You can't give medical advice
- Physical symptoms need medical evaluation

**If you're not certified in specific modalities:**
- Be honest about your training
- Don't claim credentials you don't have

Clarity about your role protects everyone.

## Transference and Projection

People in guidance relationships often project:
- Seeing you as a parental figure
- Falling in love with you (transferring old patterns)
- Making you the authority they never had
- Putting you on a pedestal

This is normal—it happens in any helping relationship.

Your job:
- Recognize when it's happening
- Don't believe the projection
- Don't exploit it
- Gently redirect back to their own authority

<Callout type="important">
When someone sees you as a guru, that's information about their psychology, not about your wisdom. Never believe your own press.
</Callout>

## When to Refer Out

Know your limits and refer when:
- Mental illness symptoms (suicidality, psychosis, severe disorders)
- Need for medical evaluation
- Trauma beyond your training
- Legal/financial advice needed
- The relationship isn't working
- You're triggered or compromised

Referring out is good ethics, not failure.

---

## Money and Exchange

If you charge for guidance:
- Be clear about fees upfront
- Don't create financial dependence
- Consider sliding scale or scholarship
- Never exploit financial power

Money doesn't make guidance less sacred—but it does add complexity.

---

## Key Ideas

- Guidance creates power dynamics
- Power can help or harm—ethics ensure it helps
- Core principles: no harm, consent, confidentiality, boundaries, competence
- Be clear about what you're not (therapist, doctor, etc.)
- Recognize and don't believe projection
- Know when to refer out
- Handle money with integrity

*With influence comes responsibility. Take both seriously.*
