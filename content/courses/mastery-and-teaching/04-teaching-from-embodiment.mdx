## Two Ways to Teach

There are two fundamentally different ways to share knowledge:

**From information:**
- Passing on concepts you've learned
- Repeating what worked for others
- Teaching from the head

**From embodiment:**
- Sharing what you've become
- Transmitting from lived experience
- Teaching from the whole self

Information can be read in books. Embodiment can only be transmitted person-to-person.

## What Embodiment Means

Embodiment means the teaching lives in you—not just as knowledge, but as:

- How you respond to stress
- How you hold yourself
- How you listen
- How you handle difficulty
- Your presence in the room
- The quality of your attention

People learn as much from your being as from your words.

<Callout type="important">
Students learn more from who you are than from what you say. If there's a gap between your teaching and your being, they feel it—even if they can't name it.

## Teaching Through Being

When you teach from embodiment:

**Your presence teaches regulation**
If you're regulated, they co-regulate with you. If you're anxious, they feel that too.

**Your authenticity teaches authenticity**
When you're real (including about your struggles), they learn it's safe to be real.

**Your humility teaches humility**
Admitting not-knowing models that it's okay not to know.

**Your boundaries teach boundaries**
How you hold your limits teaches them about holding theirs.

<Exercise title="Your Embodiment Gap">

Assess the gap between what you teach and who you are.

<Journal

  prompt="Consider:

WHAT DO YOU TEACH/SHARE?

WHERE DO YOU FULLY EMBODY THIS?
(Where is there no gap between teaching and being?)

WHERE IS THERE A GAP?
(What do you teach but struggle to live?)

HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THE GAP?"

## The Gap Is Okay

You don't have to be perfect to teach. The gap between teaching and embodiment is part of being human.

What matters:
- You're aware of the gap
- You're honest about it (with yourself and when appropriate, with students)
- You're still working on it
- You don't pretend the gap doesn't exist

Authenticity about your ongoing process is itself a teaching.

## How to Cultivate Embodiment

Embodiment deepens through:

**Continued practice**
Keep doing the work, even as you teach. Especially as you teach.

**Time**
Embodiment can't be rushed. It takes years for teachings to become character.

**Feedback**
Let others mirror back what they see. Notice gaps between intention and impact.

**Failure**
Moments when you don't embody what you teach are growth opportunities.

**Reflection**
Regular review: "Am I living what I teach?"

## Teaching to Your Growing Edge

You don't have to be at optimization to teach.

You can teach from wherever you are, as long as:
- You're honest about where you are
- You've done real work on what you're teaching
- You're not pretending to be further along
- You frame it appropriately ("This is what I've learned so far...")

Teaching at your edge keeps you humble and growing.

## What Transmits

Beyond words, what transmits person-to-person:

- **Presence** — The quality of your attention
- **Groundedness** — Your relationship with your body
- **Openness** — Your capacity to receive
- **Love** — Your genuine care for their flourishing
- **Trust** — Your faith in their capacity

These can't be faked. They can only be cultivated.

## Key Ideas

- Teaching from information vs. teaching from embodiment
- People learn from who you are, not just what you say
- Your being teaches: regulation, authenticity, humility, boundaries
- The gap between teaching and being is human—work with it openly
- Embodiment deepens through practice, time, feedback, failure
- You can teach at your edge, with honesty
- What truly transmits: presence, groundedness, openness, love, trust

*The most powerful teaching is who you've become.*
