## The Urge to Fix

When someone is struggling, there's a natural urge to fix:
- Give advice
- Solve the problem
- Make the pain go away
- Share what worked for you

This urge comes from caring. But acting on it often doesn't help—and can harm.

## Why Fixing Doesn't Help

When you rush to fix:

**You take away their agency**
They learn to look outside for solutions instead of developing their own wisdom.

**You imply they can't handle it**
Your fixing says: "You need me to solve this for you."

**Your solution may not fit**
What worked for you may not work for them. Paths are individual.

**The process gets short-circuited**
Sometimes people need to be in the difficulty to find their way through.

**They don't feel heard**
Fixing is often a way of not being with pain.

## What Holding Space Means

Holding space is:
- Being fully present with someone
- Without trying to change their experience
- Creating safety for their process
- Trusting their capacity
- Accompanying, not directing

It's harder than fixing. And far more powerful.

## The Practice of Presence

Holding space requires:

### Regulation
You must be regulated enough to stay present. If their distress dysregulates you, you'll fix to make yourself feel better.

### Emptiness
Put down your agenda, opinions, solutions. Be empty enough to receive them.

### Curiosity
Wonder about their experience rather than knowing what they need.

### Trust
Trust their capacity to find their way. They're not broken.

### Silence
Don't fill every gap. Silence creates space for deeper emergence.

## What to Say (And Not Say)

**Instead of:**
- "You should..." (advice)
- "Have you tried..." (solutions)
- "At least..." (silver lining)
- "I know how you feel" (centering yourself)
- "That reminds me of when I..." (hijacking)

**Try:**
- "That sounds hard" (validation)
- "Tell me more" (invitation)
- "What's that like for you?" (curiosity)
- Silence + presence (just being)
- "I'm here" (accompaniment)

<Callout type="gentle">
Sometimes the most healing thing you can do is simply stay. Not fix, not advise, not interpret. Just stay, fully present, while they find their way.
</Callout>

## When They Ask for Help

Sometimes people do want input. When they explicitly ask:
- Still pause first
- Ask clarifying questions
- Offer tentatively: "One thing that helped me..." not "You should..."
- Check if it landed: "Does that fit for you?"

Even when giving input, stay curious. Don't attach to your advice being taken.

---

## Your Own Discomfort

The urge to fix often comes from your discomfort with their pain.

When you notice the fix urge:
1. **Pause** — Don't act on it immediately
2. **Turn inward** — What am I feeling? What's my discomfort?
3. **Regulate** — Breathe, ground, settle yourself
4. **Return** — From your own regulation, be present again

You can't hold space from dysregulation.

<Exercise title="Practice Presence">

Practice holding space.

<Journal

  prompt="Next time someone shares something difficult:

NOTICE YOUR URGE TO FIX:
What did you want to say/do?

WHAT YOU DID INSTEAD:
How did you hold space?

WHAT HAPPENED:
What emerged when you didn't fix?"
