## The Risk of Depletion

Helping others is meaningful work. It's also draining.

People who guide others face real risks:
- Compassion fatigue
- Burnout
- Secondary trauma (absorbing others' pain)
- Neglecting their own practice
- Losing themselves in service

Your capacity to help depends on your wellbeing. Protecting yourself IS serving others.

## The Helper's Trap

Many people drawn to helping have a pattern:
- Giving feels easier than receiving
- Their worth is tied to being useful
- Others' needs come before their own
- They forget they have needs too

This pattern may have brought you to the work. It can also destroy you in it.

<Callout type="important">
You cannot pour from an empty cup. Protecting your own practice isn't selfish—it's necessary. You serve no one by burning out.

## Non-Negotiables

To sustain helping work, certain things must be non-negotiable:

### Your own practice
Whatever practice got you here—meditation, therapy, body work—keep doing it. Don't let teaching replace practice.

### Boundaries
Clear limits on how much, when, and with whom. Not every request is yours to fulfill.

### Rest
Actual rest. Not "productive" rest. Fallow time.

### Your own support
Supervision, therapy, peers. You need people to hold you while you hold others.

### Life outside the work
Relationships, play, beauty. Don't let helping become your whole identity.

---

## Boundaries in Practice

Practical boundaries:

**Time:**
- Limited hours for this work
- Not available 24/7
- Breaks between sessions

**Number:**
- Maximum capacity you'll hold
- Knowing when you're full

**Who:**
- Who you're equipped to work with
- Who you're not (refer them out)

**How:**
- What you will and won't do
- Where you'll meet

**Money:**
- Fair exchange that sustains you
- Not undercharging out of false humility

---

## Supervision and Support

Everyone who guides others needs someone to hold them:

**Supervision:**
Regular meetings with someone more experienced to discuss your work.

**Therapy:**
Your own ongoing work. The stuff that arises when helping others goes somewhere.

**Peers:**
Others doing similar work. Mutual support and reality-checking.

**Non-work relationships:**
People who know you outside this role.

## Signs You're Over-Extended

Warning signs to watch for:

- Dreading sessions
- Feeling nothing when hearing pain
- Constant exhaustion
- Resentment toward those you help
- Neglecting your own practice
- Merging with others' problems
- Loss of perspective
- Physical symptoms

When these appear, pull back. Rest. Get support.

---

## The Long Game

This work is a marathon, not a sprint.

Pacing yourself means:
- Building slowly
- Saying no to protect yes
- Resting before you're depleted
- Knowing this is years, decades of service
- Not trying to help everyone

You serve more people by lasting than by burning bright and flaming out.

---

## Key Ideas

- Helping others is draining—protect yourself
- The helper's trap: giving feels easier than having needs
- Non-negotiables: practice, boundaries, rest, support, life outside work
- Everyone needs supervision and their own support
- Watch for warning signs of over-extension
- This is a marathon—pace yourself
- Protecting yourself IS serving others
