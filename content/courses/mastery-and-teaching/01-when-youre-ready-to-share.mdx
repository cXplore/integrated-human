## The Call to Share

At some point in the integration journey, something shifts.

You've done the work—deeply, over years. What was once effortful has become natural. What you learned has become who you are.

And now you feel a pull: to share, to guide, to help others find what you've found.

This course is for that moment.

## Not Everyone Should Teach

Let's start with an uncomfortable truth: not everyone who's done personal work should teach it.

Teaching and guiding require:
- Deep embodiment of the material (not just knowledge)
- Ongoing self-work (you're never "done")
- Emotional regulation to hold others' process
- Humility to not impose your path on others
- Ethics to navigate power dynamics
- Self-awareness about your limitations

Having had a breakthrough doesn't qualify you to guide others through theirs.

## Signs of Readiness

You might be ready to share when:

**Time has passed**
Not just peak experiences, but years of integration. The work has settled into you.

**It's embodied, not just understood**
You don't just know it—you ARE it. It's become automatic, part of your character.

**You still practice**
The work continues. You're still learning, still growing, still being humbled.

**You can hold space**
When others are in pain, you can be present without rushing to fix.

**You know your limits**
You're clear about what you can help with and what's beyond your scope.

**It's not about you**
Your ego isn't driving the desire to teach.

<Exercise title="Readiness Self-Assessment">

Honestly assess your readiness.

<Journal
  id="mat-readiness"
  prompt="Reflect honestly:

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS WORK?

IS IT EMBODIED OR STILL MOSTLY INTELLECTUAL?
(How do you know?)

WHERE IS YOUR EGO IN THE DESIRE TO TEACH?

WHAT ARE YOUR LIMITATIONS?
(What should you NOT try to help with?)

ARE YOU STILL A STUDENT YOURSELF?"

## The Danger of Teaching Too Soon

When people teach before they're ready:

- They impose their path on others (not everyone's path is the same)
- They get triggered by students and react poorly
- They burn out (haven't built the capacity)
- They do harm (unresolved stuff gets projected)
- They create dependence instead of empowerment
- Their own practice suffers

Teaching is not a graduation from student. It's a different kind of studenthood.

<Callout type="important">
The best teachers are those who are still learning. The moment you think you've "arrived" is the moment you've lost something essential.

## Forms of Sharing

Sharing doesn't have to mean formal teaching:

**Informal sharing**
- Being present for friends in their process
- Modeling integration in how you live
- Answering when asked

**Semi-formal**
- Leading discussions or groups
- Mentoring individuals
- Creating content

**Formal**
- Professional coaching/therapy (requires training/credentials)
- Teaching courses
- Writing books
- Leading retreats

Start informal. Let it grow organically.

## The Invitation, Not the Push

A key principle: share when invited, not because you want to.

When you push your insights on others:
- It's often for you, not them
- They can't receive what they didn't ask for
- It can create resistance
- It's a form of ego

When you respond to invitation:
- They're ready to receive
- The timing is theirs
- You're serving, not imposing

Let people come to you. Trust that those who need what you offer will find it.
