## The Question That Won't Leave

At some point, the question emerges: *What am I here for?*

Maybe it came after achieving everything you were supposed to want. Maybe after a loss, a crisis, or a quiet realization that the life you're living isn't yours.

The question of purpose isn't a luxury. It's fundamental to human wellbeing.

**You're designed to need meaning. Without it, something essential is missing.**

## What Purpose Actually Is

Purpose isn't:
- A single perfect job you must find
- A grand mission to save the world
- Something you find once and never question
- Available only to special people

Purpose IS:
- An ongoing relationship with meaning
- A sense of direction and alignment
- Connection between your gifts and the world's needs
- Something that evolves as you grow

## Purpose vs. Goals

Goals and purpose are different:

### Goals:
- Specific, achievable outcomes
- Finite—you reach them or don't
- External measures of success
- What you want to accomplish

### Purpose:
- Ongoing direction and orientation
- Never "complete"
- Internal sense of meaning
- How you want to live and who you want to be

**You can achieve all your goals and still lack purpose. You can have clear purpose and still work toward goals.**

---

## The Three Layers of Purpose

Purpose operates at multiple levels:

### 1. Moment-to-Moment Purpose
- Being present in what you're doing
- Finding meaning in small acts
- Purpose in the ordinary

### 2. Role-Based Purpose
- Purpose as a parent, partner, friend
- Purpose in your work
- Purpose in your community roles

### 3. Overarching Life Purpose
- The bigger picture
- Your unique contribution
- What your life is "about"

**All layers matter. You don't need cosmic clarity to live purposefully today.**

## How This Course Works

Over the next modules, you'll:

1. **Clarify Your Values:** What actually matters to you (not what should)
2. **Discover Your Gifts:** What you're naturally built to offer
3. **Transform Wounds:** How your struggles become your wisdom
4. **Find Your Calling:** Where values, gifts, and world need intersect
5. **Live Purpose:** Making it real in daily life

**This is an exploration, not a test. You can't fail.**

## Key Concepts

- **Purpose and Wellbeing:** Sense of purpose correlates with better mental, physical, and behavioral health.

- **Purpose vs. Goals:** Goals are specific outcomes; purpose is ongoing direction and meaning.

- **Three Layers:** Purpose operates moment-to-moment, in roles, and at the life level.

- **Evolution:** Purpose isn't found once—it's an ongoing relationship that develops.

---

## What's Next

In Module 2, you'll clarify your actual values—what truly matters to you, not what you think should matter. Values are the foundation of purpose.

**Before moving on:**
- Notice where you already experience purpose
- Begin to question assumptions about what purpose "should" look like
- Open to the possibility that your purpose is still unfolding

---

*Purpose isn't a destination you arrive at. It's a direction you face. You don't have to know the whole path—just which way you're walking.*
