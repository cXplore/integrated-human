## Your Natural Gifts

You have gifts—things you're naturally built to do, express, or offer. Not because you're special in a cosmic sense, but because every person has a unique configuration.

Your gifts might be:
- Abilities and talents
- Ways of being
- How you see the world
- What you naturally offer to others
- What comes easy to you

**Discovering your gifts is essential to purpose. What you're built to offer points toward what you're here to do.**

## Why We Miss Our Gifts

Many people don't know their gifts because:

### It Comes Easy
What's easy for you seems normal. You assume everyone can do it.

### Modesty/Conditioning
You were taught not to "brag" or acknowledge strengths.

### Wrong Framework
You're looking for big, obvious talents. Gifts are often subtle.

### Never Asked
No one helped you see what's special about how you operate.

### Shadow of Comparison
You compare yourself to others and discount your own gifts.

---

## Types of Gifts

### Natural Abilities:
- Skills that came easily
- Talents you didn't have to develop
- Things you picked up quickly

### Ways of Being:
- Your natural presence
- How you make others feel
- Your characteristic energy

### Perspectives:
- How you see situations
- The angle you naturally take
- What you notice that others miss

### What Others Seek:
- Why people come to you
- What you get asked for
- The role you play in groups

### What Energizes:
- Activities that don't drain you
- What you could do for hours
- Where you lose track of time

## Evidence of Gifts

### Look for Patterns:

**Feedback:**
What compliments do you receive consistently?

**Flow States:**
When do you lose track of time?

**Early Hints:**
What did you love as a child before you learned to dismiss it?

**Effortless Excellence:**
Where do you achieve results without proportional effort?

**Envy Toward You:**
What have others been envious of in you?
