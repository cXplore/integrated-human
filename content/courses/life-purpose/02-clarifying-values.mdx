## Values as Foundation

Your values are the foundation of purpose. They're what matters to you—the principles and qualities you want to guide your life.

The problem: Many of us carry values we didn't choose. We inherited them from family, absorbed them from culture, or adopted them to fit in.

**To find your purpose, you must first know what you actually value—not what you think you should value.**

---

## Inherited vs. Chosen Values

### Inherited Values:
- Came from parents, culture, religion
- May or may not fit who you actually are
- Often unconscious
- Can feel like obligation rather than alignment

### Chosen Values:
- Consciously examined and selected
- Resonate with your authentic self
- Felt from within, not imposed from without
- Provide genuine motivation

**The goal isn't to reject all inherited values—some may genuinely fit. The goal is to examine and choose consciously.**

## How to Know Your Values

### Clues to Your Values:

**What angers you:**
When you see injustice, what kind? That reveals what you value.

**Where you spend time and money:**
Not where you think you should—where you actually do.

**What you admire:**
The qualities you respect in others hint at your values.

**What you can't compromise:**
Where you won't bend, even at cost.

**Peak moments:**
Times when you felt most alive—what was present?

**Regrets:**
What you regret often points to values you didn't honor.

## Values Conflicts

Sometimes values conflict. This is normal.

### Examples:
- Freedom vs. Security
- Achievement vs. Family
- Independence vs. Intimacy
- Adventure vs. Stability

### Working with Conflicts:
1. Recognize the conflict exists
2. Notice which value wins when they clash
3. Consider if this is what you want
4. Sometimes one value serves another (you want security TO have freedom)
5. Accept that life involves tradeoffs

  prompt="Do any of your values conflict? How have you handled these conflicts? Which value usually wins?"
  placeholder="Values that conflict for me:&#10;&#10;How I've handled it:&#10;&#10;Which usually wins:"

## Living Your Values

Values only matter if they guide behavior.

### Questions:
- Does your life reflect your stated values?
- Where is there alignment?
- Where is there gap?
- What would have to change to live more aligned?

### Reality Check:
If you say you value family but work 70 hours a week, there's a gap.
If you say you value creativity but never create, there's a gap.
If you say you value adventure but stay safe, there's a gap.

**The gap between stated values and lived values creates suffering.**

<Exercise title="Values Alignment">

<Journal
  id="alignment-check"
  prompt="For each of your top 5 values, how well does your current life reflect it? Where is there alignment? Where is there gap?"
  placeholder="Value 1:&#10;Alignment:&#10;Gap:&#10;&#10;Value 2:&#10;Alignment:&#10;Gap:&#10;&#10;(Continue for all 5)"
  rows={15}
/>

<Journal
  id="close-gap"
  prompt="What's one thing you could change to live more aligned with your values? Even something small?"
  placeholder="To live more aligned, I could:"
  rows={5}
/>

</Exercise>

## Values as Compass

Your clarified values become a compass for purpose:

- **Decisions:** Does this align with my values?
- **Opportunities:** Does this serve what I value?
- **Direction:** Where do my values point?
- **Meaning:** I'm living my values = I'm living meaningfully

**Purpose isn't separate from values. Purpose is living your values in a direction that matters.**

---

## Key Concepts

- **Inherited vs. Chosen Values:** Many values are absorbed, not chosen. Conscious examination is needed.

- **Value Clues:** What angers you, who you admire, peak experiences, and regrets reveal values.

- **Values Conflicts:** Competing values are normal; awareness helps navigate tradeoffs.

- **Living Values:** The gap between stated and lived values creates suffering.

- **Values as Compass:** Clarified values guide decisions, opportunities, and direction.

## What's Next

In Module 3, you'll discover your gifts—what you're naturally built to offer. Together with your values, gifts point toward purpose.

**Before moving on:**
- Sit with your top 5 values
- Notice where you're aligned and where there's gap
- Consider one small change toward alignment

---

*Values aren't just what you believe. They're what you live. Clarify what matters, then let it guide your way.*
