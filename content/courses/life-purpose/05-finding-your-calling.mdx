title: "Finding Your Calling"
moduleNumber: 5
description: "Where values, gifts, and world need intersect"
duration: "35 min"

## The Intersection

Your calling lives at the intersection of:

1. **Your Values:** What matters to you
2. **Your Gifts:** What you're built to offer
3. **Your Wounds:** Wisdom from your struggles
4. **World Need:** What the world actually needs

**Where these overlap, you find calling—direction that's authentic to you and valuable to others.**

---

## The Ikigai Framework

Japanese concept of *ikigai*—"reason for being"—offers a useful framework:

The intersection of:
- What you **love** (passion)
- What you're **good at** (profession)
- What the world **needs** (mission)
- What you can be **paid for** (vocation)

**While purpose isn't just about career, this framework helps locate where you might contribute.**

<Exercise title="Your Intersections">

<Journal
  id="ikigai-mapping"
  prompt="Map your own intersections:
• What do you love doing?
• What are you good at?
• What does the world need that you could provide?
• What could you realistically be paid for?"
  placeholder="What I love:&#10;&#10;What I'm good at:&#10;&#10;What the world needs that I could provide:&#10;&#10;What I could be paid for:"
  rows={12}

<Journal
  id="intersection"
  prompt="Looking at your answers, where do you see overlap? What's at the intersection of all four?"
  placeholder="Where I see overlap:&#10;&#10;What's at the center:"

## Beyond Career

Your calling doesn't have to be your job.

### Calling Can Be:
- How you parent
- How you contribute to community
- How you show up in relationships
- Art or creative work (regardless of income)
- Activism or advocacy
- Mentorship and teaching
- Simply how you live

**Not everyone can or should make their calling their career. That doesn't make the calling less valid.**

---

## The Calling Equation

Here's another way to think about it:

**Your Purpose = Your Values + Your Gifts + Your Wounds → Serving Something Larger Than Yourself**

### Breaking It Down:
- You're guided by what you value
- You offer what you're gifted to give
- You draw from the wisdom of your wounds
- You direct it toward something beyond just yourself

---

<Exercise title="Calling Equation">

<Journal
  id="equation"
  prompt="Fill in your equation:

My values of [X] + my gifts of [Y] + my wound wisdom about [Z] → Could serve [whom/what]"
  placeholder="My values of:&#10;+&#10;My gifts of:&#10;+&#10;My wound wisdom about:&#10;→&#10;Could serve:"
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## What the World Needs

Your calling must connect to something beyond yourself.

### Consider:
- What problems do you see that bother you?
- Where do you see suffering you could address?
- What's missing that you could provide?
- Whose life could you improve?
- What cause or issue draws you?

### The Need Can Be:
- Global (climate, justice, health)
- Local (your community)
- Relational (the people in your life)
- Specific (a particular group or problem)

---

<Exercise title="World Need">

<Journal
  id="world-needs"
  prompt="What needs in the world do you feel drawn to address? Where do your gifts and wound wisdom meet a real need?"
  placeholder="Needs I feel drawn to address:&#10;&#10;Where my gifts meet real need:&#10;&#10;Where my wound wisdom is relevant:"
  rows={8}
/>

## Calling as Direction, Not Destination

Your calling isn't:
- A single perfect job
- A final answer that never changes
- Something you'll be certain about
- Found once and never questioned

Your calling IS:
- A direction you face
- An ongoing relationship
- Something that evolves as you grow
- Clarified through living, not just thinking

**You don't have to have it figured out completely. You just need enough clarity to take the next step.**

---

## Multiple Callings

You may have more than one calling, or callings that shift over time.

### This Is Normal:
- Different life phases, different callings
- Multiple simultaneous callings at different scales
- Callings that evolve as you grow
- What was true at 25 may not be true at 50

---

## Signs You're Near Your Calling

### Positive Signs:
- Energy and aliveness when engaged in it
- Time passes quickly (flow)
- It uses your gifts naturally
- It aligns with your values
- You'd do it even without external reward
- Others benefit from what you offer

### Signs You Might Be Off Track:
- Consistently drained
- Using gifts you don't actually enjoy
- Serving needs you don't care about
- Doing it for external validation only
- Losing yourself rather than finding yourself

---

<Exercise title="Current Calling Check">

<Journal
  id="calling-signs"
  prompt="Looking at your current life, where do you see signs of calling—energy, alignment, contribution? Where do you see signs you might be off track?"
  placeholder="Signs of calling in my current life:&#10;&#10;Signs I might be off track:"
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Articulating Your Calling

Try to articulate your calling, even provisionally.

### Templates:
- "I'm here to [do what] for [whom] by [using what gifts/wisdom]"
- "My calling is to embody [value] through [action/expression]"
- "I serve [need] by offering [gift/wisdom]"

### Examples:
- "I'm here to help people heal trauma by sharing what I've learned through my own healing"
- "My calling is to embody creativity and inspire others to create"
- "I serve people in transition by offering my gift of presence and wisdom from my own changes"

**This doesn't have to be perfect. It's a working draft.**

---

<Exercise title="Your Calling Statement">

<Journal
  id="calling-draft"
  prompt="Draft a calling statement. Don't worry about perfection—this is a working version. What are you here to do/offer/be?"
  placeholder="My calling (working draft):&#10;&#10;I'm here to..."
  rows={8}
/>

<Journal
  id="calling-refine"
  prompt="Read your statement aloud. How does it feel? What would you adjust? Write a revised version if helpful."
  placeholder="How it feels:&#10;&#10;What I'd adjust:&#10;&#10;Revised version:"
  rows={8}
/>

## Key Concepts

- **The Intersection:** Calling lives where values, gifts, wound wisdom, and world need overlap.

- **Beyond Career:** Calling can be expressed through any area of life, not just work.

- **Direction, Not Destination:** Calling is an ongoing relationship, not a final answer.

- **Multiple Callings:** You may have several callings that shift over time.

- **Articulation:** Putting words to your calling, even imperfectly, helps clarify and commit.

## What's Next

In Module 6, you'll learn to live your purpose in daily life—making it real, not just theoretical. Purpose lives in how you spend your days.

**Before moving on:**
- Work on your calling statement
- Notice where you're already living your calling
- Consider what would change if you lived it more fully

---

*Your calling is where you come alive while serving something larger than yourself. It's already there, waiting to be recognized and lived.*
