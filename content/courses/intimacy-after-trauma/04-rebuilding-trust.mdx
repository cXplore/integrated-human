## Trust After It's Been Broken

Trauma often breaks trust—in people, in relationships, in the world, sometimes in yourself. Rebuilding trust isn't about deciding to trust. It's about experiencing trustworthiness repeatedly until the nervous system updates its expectations.

Trust is rebuilt brick by brick, through consistent action over time.

## Understanding Trust After Trauma

### What Trust Requires

Trust is built from:
- Predictable behavior
- Kept promises
- Consistent reliability
- Safe responses to vulnerability
- Repair when things go wrong

Trust is earned, not given.

### Why Trust Is Hard After Trauma

Trauma teaches:
- People who seem safe can hurt you
- Trusting leads to pain
- Vigilance is necessary for survival
- Letting your guard down is dangerous

These lessons made sense then. They may not serve you now.

### The Trust Paradox

To heal, you need safe relationships. To have safe relationships, you need to trust. But trusting feels dangerous.

This is the paradox. The way through is gradual, careful trust-building.

## Elements of Trustworthiness

### Consistency

Trustworthy people are:
- The same person in different contexts
- Reliable day after day
- Predictable in their behavior
- Not dramatically different when stressed

Inconsistency creates anxiety.

### Follow-Through

Trustworthy people:
- Do what they say they'll do
- Keep promises (or renegotiate before breaking)
- Show up when expected
- Are accountable for their commitments

Words must match actions.

### Respect for Boundaries

Trustworthy people:
- Accept "no" without punishment
- Don't push against limits
- Ask rather than assume
- Respect your autonomy

Boundary violations destroy trust immediately.

### Non-Reactivity

Trustworthy people:
- Don't punish your emotions
- Stay calm when you're distressed
- Don't make your pain about them
- Can hold space without falling apart

Reactivity creates unsafety.

### Repair

Trustworthy people:
- Acknowledge when they mess up
- Apologize genuinely
- Make amends
- Learn from mistakes

Everyone makes mistakes. Repair is what matters.

<Exercise title="Evaluating Trustworthiness">

Assess trust in your relationship.

### Part 1: Trustworthiness Evaluation

<Journal
  id="rt-evaluate"
  prompt="Evaluate your partner's (or potential partner's) trustworthiness:

Consistency (same person in different contexts):

Follow-through (do they do what they say?):

Boundary respect (how do they respond to 'no'?):

Non-reactivity (can they handle your distress?):

Repair (do they take responsibility for mistakes?):"
  placeholder="Consistency:

### Part 2: Your Trust Barriers

<Journal
  id="rt-barriers"
  prompt="Explore your barriers to trust:

• What makes it hard to trust even trustworthy people?
• What are you watching for? What are you afraid of?
• What would someone have to do to earn your trust?
• What does trust feel like in your body? What does distrust feel like?
• What's the risk if you trust?"
  placeholder="What makes trust hard:

### Part 3: Trust Evidence

<Journal
  id="rt-evidence"
  prompt="Gather evidence of trustworthiness (if applicable):

• Times your partner has been reliable:
• Times they've respected your boundaries:
• Times they've repaired well:
• Ways they've shown up for you:
• What your experience has actually been (vs. what you fear):"

## Building Trust Gradually

### Small Trust Experiments

Test trust in small ways first:
- Share something slightly vulnerable
- Ask for something small
- See if they follow through
- Notice how they respond

Small tests, low stakes.

### Building On Success

When trust is honored:
- Acknowledge it (internally or aloud)
- Let it register
- Gradually take slightly bigger risks
- Build on the foundation

Each positive experience adds a brick.

### When Trust Is Broken

If trust is violated:
- Notice what happened
- Evaluate severity
- Communicate about it
- Decide if repair is possible
- Either rebuild or reconsider the relationship

Small breaches can be repaired. Some breaches are too large.

## Self-Trust After Trauma

### Trusting Yourself

Trauma can erode self-trust:
- Did I cause this?
- Can I trust my judgment?
- Did I see warning signs?
- Can I protect myself?

Self-doubt becomes chronic.

### Rebuilding Self-Trust

Self-trust comes from:
- Honoring your own boundaries
- Listening to your intuition
- Keeping promises to yourself
- Treating yourself with respect
- Learning from experience

### Trusting Your Perception

If your reality was denied:
- Your perceptions are valid
- Your feelings are real
- You don't need external validation
- You can trust what you experience

Gaslighting doesn't make your truth less true.

## Trust in the Body

### The Body Knows

Your body registers trust:
- Relaxation and ease
- Open body language
- Regulated breathing
- Ability to be present

And distrust:
- Tension and bracing
- Closed posture
- Shallow breathing
- Hypervigilance

### Working with Body-Level Trust

Trust isn't just cognitive. The body needs to update too:
- Positive experiences with safe touch
- Nervous system learning safety
- Repeated experiences of relaxation with partner
- Body remembering safety, not just danger

<Exercise title="Building Trust Practice">

Create a trust-building approach.

### Part 1: Trust Experiments

Small experiment 1:
• What I'll share or ask for:
• What trustworthy response would look like:
• How I'll handle it if it goes well:
• How I'll handle it if it doesn't:

Small experiment 2:
• What I'll share or ask for:
• What trustworthy response would look like:

### Part 2: Self-Trust Building

<Journal

  prompt="Build self-trust:

• One boundary I'll honor for myself this week:
• One promise I'll keep to myself:

## For Partners: Being Trustworthy

### Your Responsibility

You can't make them trust. You can be trustworthy:
- Show up consistently
- Do what you say
- Respect every boundary
- Stay calm when they're triggered
- Repair when you fail

### Patience Required

Trust takes time:
- Months to years
- Two steps forward, one back
- Progress isn't linear
- Your consistency is the medicine

### When You Mess Up

You will mess up. What matters:
- Acknowledge it quickly
- Apologize genuinely
- Understand the impact
- Make amends
- Do differently next time

Repair builds trust more than perfection.

- **Self-trust:** Trusting yourself and your perception matters too
- **Body-level trust:** The nervous system needs to learn safety through experience
- **For partners:** Be trustworthy consistently; patience is required

<Callout type="important">
Trust after trauma isn't something you can force yourself to have. It's something that grows slowly when safety is present. Be patient with yourself. Be discerning about who earns your trust. And remember: you deserve to be with people who are genuinely trustworthy.

*Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets. Choose partners who fill the bucket drop by drop.*
