## The Foundation

Before you can find work that fits, you need to know what it needs to fit.

This isn't about personality tests or career aptitude quizzes (though those can have some value). It's about going deeper: What actually matters to you? What are you genuinely good at? What are you authentically drawn to?

This is the foundation everything else is built on.

---

## Values: Your Non-Negotiables

Values are what matters most to you. They're the principles you won't compromise, the things that make life feel meaningful.

When work aligns with values, it feels right—even when it's hard.
When work conflicts with values, it erodes you—even when it pays well.

### Clarifying Your Values

Values aren't what you think you SHOULD value. They're what you actually value—revealed by how you spend your time, what you sacrifice for, what bothers you when violated.

**Questions to surface values:**
- When have you felt most alive at work? What was present?
- When have you felt most violated at work? What was absent?
- What would you do even if no one paid you?
- What angers you when you see it missing in the world?
- What do you want to be known for?

### Common Values Categories

**Impact:** Making a difference, helping others, contribution, service
**Freedom:** Autonomy, independence, flexibility, self-direction
**Growth:** Learning, development, challenge, mastery
**Connection:** Relationships, collaboration, community, belonging
**Security:** Stability, predictability, safety, comfort
**Recognition:** Achievement, status, respect, accomplishment
**Creativity:** Innovation, expression, originality, making
**Integrity:** Honesty, authenticity, ethics, alignment
**Adventure:** Novelty, excitement, risk, exploration

Your top 5-7 values become criteria for evaluating work possibilities.

## Gifts: What You're Actually Good At

Gifts are your natural abilities—things that come relatively easily to you that others find difficult.

Everyone has gifts. Often we discount ours because they feel easy ("doesn't everyone do this?"). But what's easy for you may be hard for others.

### Types of Gifts

**Cognitive gifts:** How you think
- Analytical, seeing patterns, understanding systems
- Creative, generating ideas, making connections
- Strategic, planning, foreseeing outcomes
- Practical, implementing, making things work

**Relational gifts:** How you connect
- Understanding people, reading situations
- Communicating, influencing, teaching
- Leading, organizing, bringing people together
- Supporting, nurturing, creating safety

**Creative gifts:** What you make
- Writing, visual art, music, design
- Building, crafting, physical creation
- Problem-solving, innovating, inventing
- Curating, synthesizing, organizing information

**Practical gifts:** How you get things done
- Organizing, systematizing, creating order
- Executing, producing, delivering results
- Troubleshooting, fixing, solving problems
- Managing details, quality, precision

### Finding Your Gifts

**What comes easily to you that others struggle with?**
What do people ask you for help with? What do you do well without much effort?

**What do you receive compliments on?**
What do others notice about you? What gets appreciated?

**What could you do for hours without noticing time passing?**
When you're in flow, what are you doing?

**What were you good at as a child?**
Before conditioning, what were your natural tendencies?

## Interests: What Genuinely Draws You

Interests are different from skills. They're what you're drawn to, curious about, fascinated by—regardless of whether you're good at it (yet).

### Genuine vs. Conditioned Interests

**Conditioned interests:** Things you pursued because you should, because they're impressive, because others expected it
**Genuine interests:** Things you're authentically drawn to, even if impractical or unimpressive

The distinction matters. Conditioned interests lead to careers that look right but feel wrong. Genuine interests—even strange or impractical ones—point toward aliveness.

### Uncovering Genuine Interests

**What did you love before you had to be practical?**
Before career concerns, what captivated you?

**What do you read about, watch, or explore in your free time?**
Where does your attention go when no one's directing it?

**What topics make you come alive in conversation?**
When do you find yourself energized, talking with passion?

**If money were no object, what would you do?**
Remove the practical constraint. What emerges?

**What have you always wanted to try but haven't?**
What's been calling that you've dismissed as impractical?

---

## The Intersection

The sweet spot for career direction is where these three elements overlap:

**Values + Gifts + Interests = Alignment Zone**

Work in this zone:
- Matters to you (values)
- Uses what you're good at (gifts)
- Engages what you're interested in (interests)

This doesn't mean finding one perfect job title. It means understanding the elements that need to be present for work to feel right.

Multiple paths could satisfy these criteria. You're not looking for THE answer—you're clarifying the parameters.

---

## What About Practical Concerns?

Values, gifts, and interests are one part of the equation. But so are:

**Financial needs:** What do you actually need to live? (Often less than we think, but real)
**Market demand:** What will people pay for?
**Skills:** What can you actually do? (Different from gifts—gifts can be developed into skills)
**Constraints:** Geography, family, health, life stage

The goal isn't to ignore these. It's to not let them override the foundation.

Many people build careers entirely on practical concerns and wake up unfulfilled. Others ignore practical concerns entirely and struggle financially.

The integration: Honor both what matters AND what's practical. Neither alone is sufficient.

## Beyond This Module

You now have the foundation: a clearer sense of what matters to you, what you're good at, and what genuinely interests you.

This isn't the answer to "what should I do?" It's the criteria for evaluating possibilities. Any direction you consider can be assessed against these elements.

In Module 4, we'll look at navigating the transition itself—the messy middle between where you are and where you're going.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Values:** What matters most, your non-negotiables
- **Gifts:** Natural abilities that come easily to you
- **Interests:** What genuinely draws and fascinates you
- **The intersection:** Where values, gifts, and interests overlap is the alignment zone
- **Both/and:** Honor what matters AND what's practical

---

*When you know what matters to you, you can recognize it when you find it.*
