## Forest Bathing (Shinrin-yoku)

### The Japanese Practice

Forest bathing is:
- Slow, sensory immersion in forest atmosphere
- Not exercise or hiking
- Being in the forest, not just moving through it
- Absorbing the forest with all senses

### How to Forest Bathe

The practice:
1. Enter a forest or natural area
2. Leave devices behind or off
3. Move very slowly or sit
4. Open all senses
5. Take in the atmosphere
6. Stay for at least 2 hours

### What Happens

Forest bathing produces:
- Stress reduction
- Immune enhancement
- Mood improvement
- Sensory awakening
- Deep restoration

### Adapting the Practice

If no forest:
- Parks with trees
- Gardens
- Any natural area
- Adapt principles to available nature

## Outdoor Meditation

### Nature as Meditation Space

Meditating outdoors offers:
- Natural sound as anchor
- Wider awareness than indoor
- Connection to larger than self
- Sensory richness

### Forms of Nature Meditation

Options include:
- **Traditional sitting:** Doing your usual practice outside
- **Sound meditation:** Using natural sounds as focus
- **Sky gazing:** Open awareness with sky as field
- **Walking meditation:** Very slow, attentive walking
- **Awareness of awareness:** Being present in nature

### Practical Considerations

For outdoor meditation:
- Find a comfortable spot
- Dress for weather
- Start with shorter sessions
- Allow for imperfection (distractions are okay)
- Let nature be part of the practice, not obstacle

## Mindful Walking

### Walking With Presence

Mindful walking in nature means:
- Moving slowly
- Attending to feet meeting ground
- Noticing environment as you move
- Staying present rather than goal-oriented
- Stopping whenever called to

### How to Practice

Simple approach:
1. Walk slowly (half your normal pace or slower)
2. Feel feet on earth
3. Take in surroundings
4. When mind wanders, return to walking and sensing
5. Stop whenever something draws attention

### Duration

Start with:
- 10-15 minute walks
- Building to longer practice
- Can be part of any time in nature

## Nature Journaling

### Recording the Encounter

Nature journaling is:
- Writing and/or drawing what you observe
- Not art—observation
- A way of looking more closely
- Creating relationship through attention

### What to Record

You might note:
- What you see in detail
- Sounds and smells
- Weather and light
- Your questions about what you observe
- Feelings and impressions
- Simple drawings (skill doesn't matter)

### How to Journal

Approach:
- Bring a simple notebook outdoors
- Sit in one place
- Observe and record
- Draw what you see (even badly)
- Ask questions you don't know answers to

### The Value

Journaling develops:
- Close observation
- Pattern recognition
- Connection to specific places
- Record of relationship over time

---

## Solo Time in Nature

### Being Alone Outside

Solo time offers:
- Undistracted attention
- Your own pace
- Silence and solitude
- Encounter with yourself and nature

### Levels of Solo Practice

Range of intensity:

- **Medium:** A full day
- **Intensive:** Multi-day solo (requires preparation)

### Safety Considerations

For solo time:
- Tell someone where you're going
- Know your limits
- Start with shorter, closer experiences
- Build up gradually
- Carry appropriate supplies

## Building Regular Practice

### Realistic Approach

Start where you are:

### Integration Not Addition

Don't add nature to busy life:

<Callout type="important">
Pick one or two practices to start. Trying everything leads to nothing sustained. Choose what resonates, practice consistently, and add more as capacity grows. The goal is ongoing relationship, not one-time experiences.

*Practice isn't about perfection. It's about returning, again and again, to the living world.*
