## Not Just Nice—Necessary

Nature isn't a luxury. It's not a pleasant add-on to a complete life. Connection with the natural world is necessary for human flourishing. Research increasingly confirms what our ancestors knew: we need nature.

This module explores why.

## Physical Benefits

### The Research Is Clear

Time in nature:
- Lowers blood pressure
- Reduces cortisol (stress hormone)
- Improves immune function
- Enhances sleep quality
- Increases physical activity

### Specific Findings

Studies show:
- **Forest bathing:** 2 hours in forest increases natural killer cells for 7 days
- **Green space:** Living near greenery reduces mortality
- **Sunlight:** Natural light regulates circadian rhythms
- **Air:** Forest air contains beneficial phytoncides
- **Walking outdoors:** More health benefits than equivalent indoor exercise

### We're Built for Nature

Our bodies evolved in natural environments:
- Our eyes adapted to natural light
- Our skin needs sun exposure
- Our lungs need fresh air
- Our bodies expect movement in varied terrain
- Our microbiomes developed with environmental microbes

## Mental Health Benefits

### Stress Reduction

Nature reduces stress through:
- Lower cortisol levels
- Reduced blood pressure
- Decreased heart rate
- Calmer nervous system activation
- Mental recovery from fatigue

### Attention Restoration

Nature restores attention through:
- "Soft fascination" (engaging without effort)
- Relief from directed attention fatigue
- Mental rest while still engaged
- Return of cognitive capacity

Unlike digital media, nature refreshes rather than depletes.

### Mood Enhancement

Time in nature:
- Reduces anxiety
- Reduces depression symptoms
- Increases positive emotion
- Decreases rumination
- Enhances overall wellbeing

### Specific Effects

Research findings:
- **90-minute nature walk:** Reduces activity in brain region associated with rumination
- **Green prescriptions:** Nature exposure prescribed by doctors improves outcomes
- **Window views:** Hospital patients with tree views recover faster
- **Urban parks:** Even small green spaces reduce mental health issues

## The Dose Response

### How Much Is Needed?

Research suggests:
- **Minimum:** Even 15-20 minutes helps
- **Optimal:** 120 minutes per week for wellbeing benefits
- **More is better:** Additional time provides additional benefits
- **Intensity matters:** Immersive experience more beneficial than passing through

### Quality Matters

Not just quantity:
- Attention to nature enhances effects
- Immersion matters more than presence
- Natural areas better than manicured landscapes
- Biodiversity seems to enhance benefits

### Access Matters

Availability affects outcomes:
- Those with easy access benefit more
- Urban nature provides benefits (less than wilderness)
- Views of nature help (less than being in it)
- Indoor plants help (less than outdoor nature)
