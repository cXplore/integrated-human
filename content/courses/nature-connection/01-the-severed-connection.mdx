## We Forgot Where We Came From

Humans evolved in nature—we are nature. For hundreds of thousands of years, our ancestors lived in intimate relationship with the natural world. Every day involved direct contact with earth, plants, animals, weather, and seasons.

Now, most of us spend 90% or more of our time indoors. We live in climate-controlled environments, eat food with no connection to land, and experience nature primarily through screens.

Something has been severed.

---

## How We Got Here

### The Gradual Separation

The disconnection happened in stages:
- Agriculture concentrated us away from wilderness
- Cities intensified separation from land
- Industrialization moved life indoors
- Technology created virtual environments
- Work became desk-based for many
- Entertainment moved to screens

### The Speed of Change

Consider:
- Our bodies evolved for a world without walls
- Our nervous systems expect natural rhythms
- Our senses developed for reading nature
- For 99.9% of human history, we lived outdoors

Now we live almost entirely indoors—a radical experiment.

### Not Nostalgia

This isn't:
- Romanticizing the past
- Rejecting technology
- Pretending we can go back

It's:
- Acknowledging what was lost
- Understanding the cost
- Finding ways to reconnect

<Exercise title="Your Nature History">

Examine your personal relationship with nature.

### Part 1: Childhood Nature

<Journal
  id="tsc-childhood"
  prompt="Recall your childhood experience with nature:

• What was your relationship with nature as a child?
• Where did you spend time outdoors?
• What natural experiences were formative?
• How did nature feel to you then?
• What connection to nature have you maintained or lost?"

### Part 2: Current Connection

<Journal
  id="tsc-current"
  prompt="Assess your current nature connection:

• How much time do you spend in nature now?
• Where and how do you encounter nature?
• What's your relationship with the natural world?
• What do you feel when you're in nature?
• How connected or disconnected do you feel?"

## What We've Lost

### Sensory Deprivation

Indoor life deprives us of:
- Varied natural light
- Unfiltered air
- Diverse sounds
- Complex textures
- Rich smells
- Weather on skin

We live in sensory poverty.

### Rhythmic Disconnection

We've lost natural rhythms:
- Sunrise and sunset (artificial light)
- Seasons (climate control)
- Lunar cycles (indoor living)
- Weather awareness (insulation)

Our bodies evolved for these rhythms; we ignore them.

### Relationship with Other Life

We've lost relationship with:
- Plants and trees
- Animals and birds
- Insects and microbes
- The living world around us

We live surrounded by human-made things.

### Ecological Awareness

We don't know:
- Where our water comes from
- What grows where we live
- What animals live nearby
- What season it truly is
- How our actions affect ecosystems

We're ecologically illiterate.

---

## The Invisible Cost

### Physical Impact

Nature disconnection affects:
- Vitamin D levels (sun exposure)
- Immune function (microbial diversity)
- Circadian rhythms (natural light)
- Physical activity patterns
- Respiratory health (air quality)

### Mental Health Impact

Disconnection correlates with:
- Higher stress levels
- More anxiety and depression
- Reduced attention capacity
- Increased rumination
- Lower wellbeing

### Spiritual Impact

Losing nature connection means:
- Reduced sense of wonder
- Weakened awe experiences
- Loss of feeling part of something larger
- Diminished sense of meaning
- Disconnection from the sacred in the ordinary

<Exercise title="The Cost for You">

Examine what nature disconnection has cost you.

### Part 1: What You Miss

<Journal
  id="tsc-miss"
  prompt="Consider what you're missing:

• What sensory experiences are absent from your daily life?
• What natural rhythms are you out of touch with?
• What living things are you disconnected from?
• What outdoor experiences are rare?
• What do you notice when you return to nature?"

### Part 2: Impact on You

<Journal
  id="tsc-impact"
  prompt="Assess the impact of disconnection:

• How might nature disconnection affect your physical health?
• How might it affect your mental health?
• How might it affect your spiritual life?
• What would be different if you spent more time in nature?
• What's the cost of your current lifestyle?"

## We Are Still Nature

### Not Separate, Separated

The disconnection is experiential, not ontological:
- We are biological beings
- We are made of earth elements
- We breathe, eat, excrete—natural processes
- We are animals
- Nature is not "out there"—it includes us

### The Illusion of Separation

Modern life creates illusion:
- Walls seem to separate us from outdoors
- Air conditioning masks our embeddedness
- Packaged food hides our dependence
- Technology creates virtual worlds

But we remain natural beings in a natural world.

### Recognition, Not Reunion

Reconnecting isn't:
- Returning to something foreign
- Visiting something other
- Adding nature to our lives

It's:
- Remembering what we are
- Recognizing where we belong
- Coming home

---

## Why Reconnect?

### What's Possible

Nature reconnection offers:
- Physical health benefits
- Mental health improvement
- Spiritual depth
- Enhanced quality of life
- Sense of belonging
- Perspective and wisdom

### The Rest of This Course

We'll explore:
- The benefits of nature connection
- How to pay attention in nature

### The Invitation

This course invites you:
- To spend time in nature
- To pay attention when there
- To remember you belong
- To develop ongoing relationship

## Key Concepts

- **The severed connection:** Modern life has separated us from nature
- **Gradual separation:** Agriculture, cities, industry, technology
- **What we've lost:** Sensory richness, natural rhythms, relationship with life, ecological awareness
- **The cost:** Physical, mental, and spiritual impacts
- **We are nature:** The separation is experiential, not actual
- **Reconnection as homecoming:** Remembering what we are

<Callout type="important">
This course is experiential. The modules include suggestions for outdoor time and nature practices. You'll get more from the course if you actually spend time in nature while taking it. Reading about nature isn't the same as being in it.
