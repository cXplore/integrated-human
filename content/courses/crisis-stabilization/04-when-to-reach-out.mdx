## The Myth of Self-Sufficiency

We often believe we should be able to handle everything ourselves. That needing help is weakness. That asking for support means we've failed.

This is a myth. A harmful one.

Humans are wired for connection. We're not meant to face everything alone. Reaching out isn't failure—it's how we're designed to survive.

---

## Signs You Need Support

Sometimes we need more than self-help. Consider reaching out if:

- The intensity isn't passing
- You're having thoughts of harming yourself
- You can't function (eating, sleeping, basic care)
- You've been in crisis for more than a few days
- You're using substances to cope
- You feel completely alone
- Your usual strategies aren't working
- Something is telling you that you need help

Trust that voice. It's not dramatic. It's accurate.

## Levels of Support

Support exists on a spectrum:

### Level 1: Informal Support
- A friend who can listen
- A family member who cares
- An online community
- A pet or companion

### Level 2: Semi-Formal Support
- Support groups
- Peer counselors
- Spiritual advisors
- Coaches or mentors

### Level 3: Professional Support
- Therapists and counselors
- Psychiatrists
- Crisis counselors
- Treatment programs

### Level 4: Emergency Support
- Crisis hotlines (988 in US)
- Emergency rooms
- Crisis stabilization units
- Mobile crisis teams

You don't have to start at Level 4. But don't wait until you need Level 4 when Level 2 would help now.

## Why We Don't Reach Out

Even when we need help, we often don't ask. Common blocks:

**"I don't want to burden anyone"**
People who care about you want to know when you're struggling. Letting them help is a gift to them too.

**"They won't understand"**
They might not understand perfectly. But perfect understanding isn't required for support.

**"It's not bad enough"**
There's no threshold you have to meet. If you're struggling, you deserve support.

**"I should be able to handle this"**
Says who? Handling things alone isn't a virtue. It's often just isolation.

**"I don't know what to say"**
You can just say "I'm having a hard time." That's enough to start.

<Callout type="important">
Asking for help is not weakness. It's wisdom. It means you know that humans aren't meant to face everything alone—and you're brave enough to act on that knowledge.

## How to Reach Out

If asking for help feels hard, here are some scripts:

**To a friend:**
"Hey, I'm going through a really hard time. I don't need you to fix anything, I just need someone to know."

**To a family member:**
"I'm struggling more than I've let on. Can we talk?"

**To a therapist/professional:**
"I need to see someone soon. I'm in crisis and need support."

**To a crisis line:**
"I'm not okay and I need to talk to someone."

You don't have to have it figured out. You just have to make contact.

<Exercise title="Your Reaching Out Script">

What could you say if you needed to reach out?

<Journal
  id="cs-script"
  prompt="Write a few sentences you could use to reach out for help.

You don't have to use them. But having them ready makes it easier when you need them.

What would you say to someone you trust?"

## After the Crisis

Once the acute crisis passes:

1. **Don't pretend it didn't happen.** It did, and it matters.
2. **Follow up on support.** If you reached out, stay connected.
3. **Consider ongoing help.** Crisis is often a signal that something needs attention.
4. **Be gentle with yourself.** Recovery takes time.
5. **Learn from it.** What helped? What would help next time?

Crisis can be a turning point—not just a breakdown, but a breakthrough. It can show us what we need.
