## When Nothing Feels Safe

In crisis, the world can feel uniformly threatening. Everything is too much, too loud, too overwhelming.

When this happens, we don't need to make everything safe. We just need to find *one* safe thing. One anchor point. One small refuge.

---

## What "Safe" Means Here

Safe doesn't mean perfect or problem-free. It means:

- Something that doesn't add to the overwhelm
- Something that feels neutral or slightly okay
- Something predictable
- Something you have some control over

It might be small. It might seem insignificant. But if it feels even slightly safer than everything else, it counts.

---

## Types of Safe Things

### Physical Safety

- A blanket or weighted object
- A specific corner or spot
- A certain temperature
- A familiar texture

### Sensory Safety

- A particular sound or music
- A smell that feels grounding
- Soft lighting
- Silence

### Relational Safety

- A pet
- A photo of someone who loves you
- A voice (even a recording)
- The memory of being held

### Internal Safety

- A breath pattern
- A word or phrase
- A visualization
- A memory of a safe time

## Creating a Pocket of Safety

Once you've identified one safe thing, you can use it to create a small pocket of safety:

1. **Go to it** (or bring it to you)
2. **Give it your attention** (really notice it)
3. **Stay with it** (don't rush)
4. **Let it anchor you** (you don't have to feel safe everywhere—just here)

This pocket doesn't solve anything. It just gives your nervous system a moment of relative calm.

---

## The Safe Enough Principle

We often wait for everything to be safe before we can relax. But that's not how safety works.

**You don't need total safety. You need "safe enough."**

Safe enough to breathe. Safe enough to rest for a moment. Safe enough to let down your guard just slightly.

One safe thing is enough to create safe enough.

You don't have to make the whole world safe. You just need one small anchor. One point of refuge. Everything else can stay uncertain while you rest here for a moment.

## Physical Grounding

If you can't find a safe thing, try using your body as an anchor:

**Feet on Floor**
- Feel the ground beneath you
- Notice the support
- You are held by something solid

**Hands on Body**
- Place hands on your chest, belly, or thighs
- Feel the warmth
- You are real and here

**5-4-3-2-1**
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

Try one of the physical grounding techniques.

  prompt="Try one of the grounding techniques:

1. Feet on floor—what do you notice?
2. Hands on body—what do you feel?
3. 5-4-3-2-1—what do you observe?

What was that like? Even slightly different?"

## Building a Safety List

When you're not in acute crisis, it helps to have a list of safe things ready. These are your go-to anchors when things get hard.

Your safety list might include:

- Physical objects (blanket, stuffed animal, stone)
- Places (a specific chair, your car, a bathroom)
- People (names you can call)
- Sensory things (songs, smells, textures)
- Practices (breathing, phrases, movements)

<Exercise title="Your Safety List">

What are some things that have felt safe in the past?

<Journal
  id="cs-safety-list"
  prompt="Make a list of things that feel (or have felt) safe to you:

OBJECTS:

PLACES:

PEOPLE:

SENSORY:

PRACTICES:

(You can add to this list over time)"

## When Nothing Feels Safe

If nothing feels safe, that's information too. It means your nervous system is in high alert.

In that case:

- Don't force it
- Focus on "less unsafe" instead of "safe"
- Start with the body (it's always with you)
- Know that this state won't last forever

Sometimes the safest thing is just time passing.

---

## Key Ideas

- You only need one safe thing to anchor
- Safe enough is enough
- Safe things can be objects, places, people, or practices
- Physical grounding uses your body as anchor
- Building a safety list prepares you for hard times
- If nothing feels safe, focus on "less unsafe"

---

*One small anchor can hold you through the storm.*
