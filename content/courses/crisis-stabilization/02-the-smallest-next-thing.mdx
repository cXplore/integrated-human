## When Everything Is Too Much

In crisis, the whole of life can feel overwhelming. The past is painful, the future is terrifying, and the present is unbearable.

When this happens, we need to shrink the frame.

Not to avoid reality. But because our nervous system can only handle so much at once. And right now, it's at capacity.

---

## The Smallest Next Thing

This is a simple practice for impossible moments:

**Don't think about the whole problem. Don't think about tomorrow. Don't even think about the rest of today.**

Just ask: *What is the smallest next thing I can do?*

Not the most important thing. Not the thing that will fix everything. Just the smallest next thing.

---

## Examples

The smallest next thing might be:

- Drink a glass of water
- Go to the bathroom
- Change your position
- Take one breath
- Look out a window
- Put on socks
- Lie down

These aren't solutions. They're just *next*. And sometimes, next is all we can manage.

<Exercise title="Your Smallest Next Thing">

What's the smallest thing you could do right now? Not should. Could.

<Journal
  id="cs-smallest"
  prompt="What is the smallest next thing you could do?

(It doesn't have to be meaningful or important. It just has to be small and doable.)"
  placeholder="The smallest thing I could do right now is..."
  rows={6}
/>

</Exercise>

## Why This Works

When we're overwhelmed, our thinking brain goes offline. The planning, problem-solving part of us shuts down. We literally can't think straight.

But we can still do small things. And each small thing:

- Gives our nervous system evidence that we can act
- Creates a tiny bit of forward motion
- Prevents the freeze from becoming total
- Buys time for the intensity to pass

Small steps aren't giving up on big problems. They're surviving long enough to address them later.

---

## The Next 5 Minutes

Sometimes even the next hour feels impossible. So we shrink further.

**What do you need to get through the next 5 minutes?**

Just 5 minutes. Then you can reassess.

This isn't avoidance. It's triage. You're in crisis, and the immediate task is stabilization, not solution.

<Callout type="important">
You don't have to figure out your life right now. You don't have to solve the problem. You just have to get through the next small increment of time. That's the only job.
</Callout>

---

## When You Can't Do Anything

Sometimes even the smallest thing feels impossible. That's okay too.

If you can't act, just exist. Lie there. Breathe. Wait.

This isn't failure. This is your body protecting itself by slowing down. It's called conservation mode, and it's actually a survival mechanism.

You don't have to force yourself to do anything. Sometimes the smallest next thing is just continuing to be.

---

## Stringing Small Things Together

When you can manage it, small things can chain together:

1. Sit up
2. Feet on floor
3. Stand
4. Walk to kitchen
5. Get water
6. Drink

Notice: at no point did we think about the whole day, the whole problem, or the whole life. We just did small things in sequence.

---

<Exercise title="A Few Small Steps">

If you feel able, try stringing 3-5 small things together.

<Journal
  id="cs-sequence"
  prompt="What are 3-5 small things you could do in sequence?

(They don't need to accomplish anything meaningful. Just small, doable steps.)"
  placeholder="1.
2.
3.
4.
5."
  rows={8}
/>

</Exercise>

## Permission to Be Small

In crisis, we often feel pressure to:

- Pull ourselves together
- Handle it
- Be strong
- Not fall apart

But sometimes falling apart is appropriate. Sometimes being small is the right response.

You're allowed to shrink. You're allowed to do less. You're allowed to only handle what you can handle.

---

## Key Ideas

- When overwhelmed, shrink the frame
- Don't think about the whole problem—just the next small thing
- Small doesn't mean unimportant
- Even doing nothing is something (it's rest)
- You only have to get through the next few minutes
- Permission to be small is permission to survive

---

*Big solutions come later. Right now, small is enough.*
