## Before We Begin

If you're here, something is hard right now. Maybe very hard.

That's okay. You don't have to pretend otherwise.

This isn't a course about fixing yourself or becoming better. It's about getting through right now—the next hour, the next few hours, maybe just the next few minutes.

Whatever brought you here, you don't have to have it figured out. You just have to keep going a little longer.

## What Crisis Actually Feels Like

Crisis isn't always dramatic. Sometimes it's:

- A numbness that won't lift
- Overwhelm that makes everything feel impossible
- Feeling like you're watching your life from outside it
- The sense that you can't do this anymore
- Everything feeling too heavy to carry

You might feel all of these. You might feel nothing at all. Both are normal responses to abnormal stress.

## You're Not Failing

If you're struggling, that's not a character flaw. It means:

- Something genuinely difficult is happening
- Your nervous system is overwhelmed
- You've reached a limit—and limits are real

Being in crisis doesn't mean you're weak. It often means you've been strong for too long, carrying too much.

You don't have to feel better right now. You just have to get through this moment. Then the next one. That's enough.

## What You Don't Have to Do

Right now, you don't have to:

- Understand why this is happening
- Have a plan to fix it
- Feel grateful or positive
- Be productive
- Take care of anyone else
- Make any decisions
- Be okay

You just have to be here. That's the only requirement.

## One Small Thing

Can you do one small thing right now?

- Take one breath (just one)
- Feel your feet on the floor
- Notice something you can see
- Put your hand on your chest

You don't have to do any of these. They're just options if you want to try something.

<Exercise title="Just Noticing">

No pressure here. Just notice where you are.

<Journal
  id="cs-noticing"
  prompt="You don't have to write much. Just a few words if you want.

What's happening right now?

How does your body feel?

Is there anything you need in this moment?"
  placeholder="Right now I'm...

My body feels...

I might need..."
  rows={10}
/>

</Exercise>

## This Will Pass

Whatever you're feeling—however permanent it seems—it will change.

Not because you're going to fix it. Not because you'll figure it out. But because everything changes. That's just how feelings work.

The intensity you're feeling right now won't stay at this level forever. It can't. Your nervous system won't let it.

This isn't toxic positivity. It's biology. Intense states naturally shift.

If you're thinking about hurting yourself, please know:

- These thoughts are more common than people admit
- Having them doesn't make you bad or broken
- They're often a sign of overwhelm, not a plan
- You can have these thoughts and still be safe
