## The Resistance

You know what you should do. You even want the outcome. But when it's time to start, something stops you. A force that says: "Not now. Later. Not this."

Steven Pressfield calls it Resistance (with a capital R). It's the enemy of doing.

Resistance isn't about the task. It's about starting. Once you start, resistance usually fades. But getting started—that's where it fights hardest.

---

## What Resistance Feels Like

Resistance shows up as:

- "I don't feel like it"
- Sudden need to do something else (cleaning, checking email)
- Fatigue or low energy
- Distracting thoughts
- Physical discomfort
- Rationalizations ("I work better under pressure")
- Creative avoidance (doing productive-feeling things instead)

These are all disguises. Resistance wears many masks.

---

## Why Resistance Exists

Resistance is a survival mechanism gone wrong.

**Your brain wants to:**
- Conserve energy (effort costs)
- Avoid uncertainty (outcomes are unknown)
- Stay comfortable (difficulty is uncomfortable)
- Avoid potential pain (failure, criticism, difficulty)

These instincts kept ancestors alive. But they're not well-suited for modern challenges where long-term rewards require short-term discomfort.

Resistance is trying to protect you. It's just not very smart about it.

## The Key Insight

**You don't need to feel like doing it to do it.**

The feeling doesn't have to precede the action. You can act despite the feeling. Often, the feeling changes once you start.

Waiting to feel motivated, inspired, or ready is a trap. These feelings often come *after* starting, not before.

### Part 1: How Resistance Shows Up

<Journal
  id="resistance-forms"
  prompt="How does resistance show up for you?

• What are your typical avoidance behaviors?
• What rationalizations do you use?
• What does resistance feel like in your body?
• What are your go-to distractions?

Know your enemy."

### Part 2: What You Tell Yourself

<Journal
  id="resistance-stories"
  prompt="What stories does resistance tell you?

• 'I'll do it when I feel...'
• 'I work better under...'
• 'I just need to first...'
• 'I can't start because...'

These are the lies resistance tells to keep you stuck."
  placeholder="'I'll do it when I feel...':

'I work better under...':

'I just need to first...':

'I can't start because...':"

### Part 3: Pattern Recognition

<Journal
  id="resistance-patterns"
  prompt="When is resistance strongest?

• Time of day?
• Type of task?
• Emotional state?
• Energy level?

Understanding patterns helps you plan around them."
  placeholder="Time of day resistance is strongest:

Types of tasks that trigger most resistance:

Emotional states that increase resistance:

Energy patterns:"

Resistance is loudest right before starting. Once you're in motion, it often quiets. The battle is won at the beginning.

## Strategies for Working with Resistance

### 1. Start Tiny
Don't start the project. Just open the document. Write one sentence. Do five minutes. The smallest possible action that gets you in motion.

### 2. The Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes, do it now. For bigger things, commit to just two minutes. Often you'll continue.

### 3. Acknowledge the Resistance
"I notice I'm resisting this." Naming it creates distance. You're observing the resistance rather than being it.

### 4. Feel It, Do It Anyway
You don't need the resistance to go away. You can feel it and act anyway. The feeling is not a stop sign.

### 5. Remove Friction
Make starting as easy as possible. Prepare things in advance. Reduce the steps between you and the task.

### 6. Use Momentum
It's easier to keep going than to start. Once you've started, ride the momentum. Start before you're ready.

## The Moment of Choice

Every time you face a task, there's a moment of choice:

**Option A:** Give in to resistance. Not now. Later.

**Option B:** Feel the resistance. Start anyway.

This moment is where procrastination is won or lost. It lasts maybe 5-10 seconds. The first few actions determine whether you work or avoid.

Become aware of this moment. Notice when it's happening. Make a different choice.

---

## When Resistance Wins

You will give in to resistance sometimes. When you do:

**Don't add guilt to avoidance.**
You already feel bad. Beating yourself up makes it worse and makes starting later even harder.

**Try again soon.**
The next opportunity is your next chance. Don't wait until tomorrow.

**Learn from it.**
What was the trigger? What story did resistance tell? How could you approach it differently?

---

## Key Concepts

- **Resistance is the enemy of starting.** It's loudest before you begin.

- **You don't need to feel like it.** Action doesn't require motivation first.

- **Start tiny.** The first step defeats most resistance.

- **There's a moment of choice.** Catch it. Choose action.

## What's Next

In Module 4, we'll explore how to make starting easier—through environment design and reducing friction.
