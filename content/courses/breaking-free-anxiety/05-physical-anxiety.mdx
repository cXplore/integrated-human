## Anxiety in the Body

Anxiety isn't just mental—it's profoundly physical. Racing heart, tight chest, shallow breathing, muscle tension, stomach upset. For many, physical symptoms are the most distressing part of anxiety. This module focuses on body-based anxiety and somatic approaches to managing it.

## Understanding Physical Anxiety

### The Mind-Body Unity

Anxiety is:
- Mental AND physical simultaneously
- Not "just in your head"
- A whole-body experience
- Felt as sensation
- The body's stress response

### Physical Symptoms

Common physical anxiety:
- Heart racing or pounding
- Chest tightness or pain
- Shortness of breath
- Muscle tension
- Stomach upset, nausea
- Sweating
- Trembling
- Dizziness
- Numbness or tingling
- Hot or cold flashes

### Why Symptoms Are Scary

Physical symptoms frighten because:
- They feel dangerous
- Heart racing feels like heart attack
- Breathing trouble feels like suffocation
- Body signals feel out of control
- Fear of symptoms creates more symptoms

## Fear of Physical Symptoms

### Secondary Fear

A common pattern:
- Body produces anxiety symptoms
- You fear the symptoms themselves
- Fear creates more symptoms
- Vicious cycle develops
- Fear of fear

### Symptoms Are Not Dangerous

The truth:
- Anxiety symptoms feel terrible but aren't dangerous
- Racing heart won't cause heart attack (in healthy person)
- You won't suffocate from chest tightness
- Dizziness won't make you faint (usually)
- Symptoms pass

### Breaking the Cycle

Break the cycle by:
- Understanding symptoms are not dangerous
- Learning to tolerate them
- Not fighting them
- Allowing them to pass
- Reducing fear of fear

## Hypervigilance to Body

### The Scanning Problem

Anxiety often involves:
- Constant body scanning
- Looking for symptoms
- Noticing every sensation
- Interpreting normal sensations as dangerous
- Finding what you're looking for

### Normal Sensations

Everyone has:
- Occasional heart skips
- Brief aches and pains
- Temporary dizziness
- Random twitches
- Digestive variation

Anxious people notice and interpret these as threatening.

### The Solution

The solution involves:
- Reducing hypervigilance
- Accepting normal sensations
- Not interpreting every sensation
- Trusting the body
- Focusing outward not inward

<Exercise title="Your Body Scanning">

Examine your hypervigilance.

<Journal

  prompt="Explore your body scanning:

• How often do you check your body for symptoms?
• What are you looking for?
• Do you interpret normal sensations as dangerous?
• What happens when you find something?
• What would less scanning look like?"

## Somatic Approaches

### Working With the Body

To reduce physical anxiety:
- Work with body, not just mind
- Learn to regulate nervous system
- Change relationship to sensations
- Build tolerance for discomfort
- Use body to calm body

### Key Principles

**Don't fight sensations:** Fighting creates tension, which increases symptoms

**Turn toward, not away:** Avoiding increases fear; facing decreases it

**Ride the wave:** Sensations peak and pass; they don't stay forever

**Use regulation tools:** Breath, grounding, movement

---

## Breath Work for Physical Anxiety

### Why Breath

The breath is powerful because:
- Directly affects nervous system
- You can control it
- Changes physiology quickly
- Always available
- Reverses hyperventilation

### Diaphragmatic Breathing

Belly breathing:
1. Place hand on belly
2. Inhale, belly rises
3. Exhale, belly falls
4. Slow, deep breaths
5. 4-6 breaths per minute

Most anxious people breathe shallowly into chest. Deep belly breathing calms.

### Paced Breathing

Slow, paced breath:
- Inhale 4-5 seconds
- Exhale 5-7 seconds
- Longer exhale activates calm
- Practice regularly
- Use when anxious

---

<Exercise title="Breath Practice">

Practice calming breath techniques.

<Journal
  id="pa-breath"
  prompt="Practice diaphragmatic breathing for 5 minutes:

During practice:
• What happened to your body?
• What sensations changed?
• What was your anxiety level before and after?

How will you incorporate this into daily life?"

## Progressive Muscle Relaxation

### The Technique

PMR involves:
- Systematically tensing and releasing muscles
- Moving through body
- Creating relaxation response
- Releasing held tension
- Teaching body to relax

### How to Practice

Basic PMR:
1. Start with feet—tense for 5 seconds
2. Release, notice relaxation
3. Move to calves, repeat
4. Continue up body: thighs, buttocks, stomach, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, face
5. End with whole-body relaxation

### When to Use

Use PMR:
- As regular practice (builds capacity)
- When noticing tension building
- Before bed
- During stressful periods
- When physical symptoms increase

---

<Exercise title="PMR Practice">

Practice Progressive Muscle Relaxation.

<Journal
  id="pa-pmr"
  prompt="Practice PMR for 15 minutes, tensing and releasing each muscle group.

After practice:

• Where did you find the most tension?
• What was the release like?
• How does your body feel now compared to before?
• What surprised you?
• How might regular practice help?"

## Working With Specific Symptoms

### Racing Heart

When heart races:
- Remind yourself it's not dangerous
- It's the body doing its job
- Slow breathing helps
- It will slow on its own
- Don't check pulse repeatedly

### Tight Chest/Trouble Breathing

When breathing feels restricted:
- You are getting enough air
- Slow down the breath
- Breathe into belly, not chest
- Let the out-breath be longer
- Chest tightness passes

### Dizziness

When dizzy:
- Ground through feet
- Slow breathing
- Look at stable object
- It will pass
- You likely won't faint (fainting requires drop in blood pressure; anxiety raises it)

### Stomach Upset

When stomach is affected:
- Normal response to stress
- Deep breathing helps
- Avoid checking (just makes worse)
- Eat normally if possible
- It will settle

---

## Interoceptive Exposure

### What It Is

Interoceptive exposure:
- Deliberately inducing physical sensations
- The same sensations that scare you
- In a controlled way
- To learn they're not dangerous
- And reduce fear of symptoms

### How It Works

By intentionally creating:
- Rapid heartbeat (exercise, running in place)
- Breathlessness (holding breath, breathing through straw)
- Dizziness (spinning, head movements)
- Chest sensations (hyperventilating briefly)

You learn:
- Sensations are not dangerous
- You can tolerate them
- Fear decreases with exposure
- Body returns to normal

### Caution

Note: If you have medical conditions, consult a doctor before interoceptive exercises. This is generally safe for healthy individuals.

• Were they as scary as expected?
• How quickly did they pass?
• What did you learn about your body?"

## Embodiment Practices

### Getting Grounded

Grounding in body:
- Feel feet on floor
- Feel seat on chair
- Notice contact points
- Sense the body from inside
- Come into physical presence

### Body Awareness

Develop body awareness:
- Regular body scans
- Notice sensations without judging
- Build tolerance for all sensations
- Become friends with body
- Not enemy of sensation

### The Goal

The goal is:
- Comfortable in your body
- Not afraid of sensations
- Able to feel without panic
- Body as home, not threat
- Embodied presence

---

## Daily Body Practice

### Building a Routine

Incorporate daily:
- Morning: Body check-in, brief grounding
- Throughout day: Breath awareness, release tension
- Evening: Progressive relaxation or body scan
- When anxious: Regulation techniques

### Consistency

Regular practice:
- Builds capacity
- Creates new defaults
- Teaches body to relax
- Makes tools automatic
- Changes baseline over time

- **Symptoms aren't dangerous:** They feel terrible but aren't harmful
- **Hypervigilance:** Over-scanning creates more anxiety
- **Somatic approaches:** Work with body, not just mind
- **Breath work:** Diaphragmatic breathing, paced breathing
- **PMR:** Tension-release for relaxation
- **Specific symptoms:** Each can be worked with
- **Interoceptive exposure:** Facing feared sensations
- **Daily practice:** Build body-based regulation habits

<Callout type="important">
Your body isn't betraying you—it's trying to protect you. Physical symptoms are uncomfortable but not dangerous. Learning to work with body sensations rather than against them changes everything. Your body can become a place of safety rather than threat.
</Callout>

*The body that holds anxiety can learn to release it.*
