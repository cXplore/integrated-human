## Anxiety With Others

Anxiety often shows up most intensely in relationships. Fear of judgment, rejection, embarrassment, and not being enough—these interpersonal fears can severely limit life. This module addresses social and relational anxiety: understanding it, and developing capacity to connect despite fear.

## Why Social Anxiety Develops

### The Roots

Social anxiety often develops from:
- Early experiences of rejection or criticism
- Bullying or social trauma
- Family environment (critical, shaming)
- Lack of social skill development
- Perfectionism and high standards
- Sensitivity to social cues

### The Maintenance

It's maintained by:
- Avoidance (prevents learning)
- Self-focus during social situations
- Negative interpretation of events
- Post-event rumination
- Safety behaviors that prevent real connection

### The Trap

The trap:
- Fear leads to avoidance
- Avoidance prevents positive experiences
- Loneliness and isolation result
- This confirms "I can't connect"
- Anxiety increases

---

## The Self-Focus Problem

### Inward Attention

During social situations, socially anxious people:
- Focus attention inward
- Monitor themselves constantly
- Notice their symptoms
- Judge their performance
- Miss what's actually happening externally

### The Problem

This self-focus:
- Makes anxiety worse
- Reduces capacity to listen
- Prevents genuine connection
- Creates the awkwardness feared
- Becomes self-fulfilling prophecy

### The Shift

The shift needed:
- From inward to outward focus
- Attention on other person, not yourself
- Curiosity about them, not monitoring self
- Presence to the interaction
- This reduces anxiety and improves connection

---

<Exercise title="Shifting Focus">

Practice shifting from self-focus to other-focus.

<Journal
  id="air-focus"
  prompt="In a social interaction, practice shifting focus:

Instead of monitoring yourself, focus on:
• What the other person is saying
• Their body language and expressions
• Being curious about them
• Listening to understand

After:
• What was it like to focus outward?
• Did self-focus decrease?
• How did the interaction go?
• What did you learn?"

## Safety Behaviors in Social Situations

### Common Safety Behaviors

In social situations, people use:
- Avoiding eye contact
- Speaking quietly or little
- Staying near walls/exits
- Only attending with trusted person
- Using alcohol to cope
- Avoiding drawing attention
- Over-preparing what to say
- Wearing certain clothes to hide

### The Problem

These behaviors:
- Prevent genuine connection
- Keep you from learning you can cope
- Often create the impression you want to avoid
- Maintain dependency
- Reinforce that you can't handle it

### Dropping Them

To truly overcome:
- Identify your safety behaviors
- Gradually drop them
- Face situations without crutches
- Learn you can cope
- Build real confidence

<Exercise title="Your Social Safety Behaviors">

Identify social safety behaviors to drop.

<Journal

  prompt="Identify your social safety behaviors:

• What do you do in social situations to feel safer?
• Which behaviors are you most dependent on?
• Which could you try dropping?
• What would dropping them teach you?

  rows={18}

</Exercise>

## Exposure for Social Anxiety

### Social Exposure

Apply exposure principles:
- Create hierarchy of social fears
- Start with lower items
- Stay in situations until anxiety decreases
- Drop safety behaviors
- Repeat until easier

### Example Hierarchy

Social anxiety hierarchy example:
1. Smile at stranger (15)
2. Small talk with cashier (25)
3. Call to make appointment (35)
4. Have coffee with acquaintance (45)
5. Attend small group event (55)
6. Speak up in meeting (65)
7. Go to party alone (75)
8. Give presentation (85)

### The Process

For each exposure:
- Enter the situation
- Stay present (external focus)
- Allow anxiety without escape
- Notice what actually happens
- Process afterward

## Post-Event Rumination

### The Pattern

After social situations:
- Replaying what happened
- Focusing on perceived mistakes
- Cringing at things said or done
- Assuming others judged negatively
- "I shouldn't have said that..."

### Why It Hurts

Post-event rumination:
- Keeps anxiety alive
- Often distorts what happened
- Confirms negative self-view
- Makes next time harder
- Is not accurate processing

### Breaking the Pattern

To reduce rumination:
- Notice when you're doing it
- Remind yourself memory is not accurate
- Ask: "Would I notice if someone else did this?"
- Shift attention to present
- If persisting, write it down once and stop

## Building Connection Skills

### Skills That Help

Social skills that reduce anxiety:
- Asking open questions

### Practice

Build skills through:
- Small, low-stakes practice
- Observing socially confident people

- Gradual increase in challenge

### The Real Goal

The goal isn't perfect performance:
- It's authentic connection
- Being yourself with others
- Tolerating imperfection
- Prioritizing connection over impression
- Accepting that not everyone will like you

---

## Working With Core Beliefs

### Underlying Beliefs

Social anxiety rests on beliefs:
- "I'm not good enough"
- "People will reject me if they know me"
- "I have to be perfect to be accepted"
- "I'm boring/awkward/unlikable"
- "I don't belong"

### Examining Beliefs

Question these beliefs:
- Is this belief true?
- What's the evidence for and against?
- Where did this belief come from?
- How would my life be different without it?
- What would I believe if I valued myself?

### New Beliefs

Work toward:
- "I'm good enough as I am"
- "Some people will like me, some won't"
- "Imperfection is human"
- "I have things to offer"
- "I belong as much as anyone"

<Exercise title="Your Core Social Beliefs">

<Callout type="important">
Social anxiety tries to protect you from rejection by keeping you isolated. But isolation guarantees the loneliness you fear. The path through is facing social situations despite fear, dropping safety behaviors, focusing outward, and allowing imperfect connection. You're more capable of connection than anxiety tells you.
