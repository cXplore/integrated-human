## Knowing Your Anxiety

Everyone's anxiety is unique. Your specific triggers, symptoms, patterns, and history create your individual anxiety profile. Understanding your particular pattern is essential—generic advice doesn't address your specific situation. This module helps you map your unique anxiety landscape.

## Why Mapping Matters

Mapping your anxiety helps you:
- See patterns you might miss
- Identify specific triggers
- Understand your unique response
- Target interventions precisely
- Track changes over time

### The Benefit

With a clear map:
- You're not fighting unknown enemy
- You know what you're working with
- Interventions can be specific
- Progress can be measured
- Mystery decreases

Consider your anxiety's origins:
- When did you first notice anxiety?
- What was happening in your life?
- Was there a triggering event?

How has anxiety evolved:

### Current State

Where is your anxiety now:
- How severe is it?
