## The Four Masculine Powers

Within every man are four archetypal energies: King, Warrior, Magician, and Lover. Each represents a fundamental aspect of mature masculinity.

Most men have developed some and neglected others. Full masculine maturity requires access to all four.

**The integrated man can draw on any archetype as the situation requires.**

---

## The Archetypal Model

### Based on:
The work of Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette, drawing on Jung's archetypal psychology.

### The Premise:
These four patterns exist in the collective male psyche. They're blueprints for mature masculine energy.

### Each Archetype:
- Has mature and immature forms
- Has gifts and shadows
- Relates to specific life domains
- Can be developed consciously

---

## The King

### The Energy:
Order, blessing, sovereignty, centeredness. The King creates and maintains the kingdom.

### Mature King:
- Centered and grounded
- Provides order and structure
- Blesses others—sees and affirms
- Makes generative decisions
- Takes responsibility
- Calm in chaos

### Immature Forms:
**Tyrant:** Controls, dominates, needs to be right
**Weakling:** Abdicates responsibility, can't lead

### Shadow:
Using power for ego rather than service. Or avoiding power entirely.

### Life Domains:
Leadership, organization, decision-making, creating structure, taking responsibility.

### In Practice:
Different situations call for different energies:
- Crisis: Warrior leads

### The Integrated Man:
Has access to all four. Draws on whichever is needed. No archetype is avoided or overused.

## Accessing Archetypes Consciously

### Daily Practice:

Call in the archetype you need for the day's challenges.

**Before Important Moments:**
Which archetype serves this situation? Call it forward.

**Evening:**
Review: Which archetypes did I use? Which did I neglect?

### Visualization:
- See the mature version of each archetype
- Imagine embodying that energy
- Let it inform your state

## Key Concepts

- **Four Archetypes:** King, Warrior, Magician, Lover—each with gifts and shadows.

- **Mature vs. Immature:** Each has developed and undeveloped forms.

- **Integration:** Access to all four, using whichever is needed.

- **Development:** Conscious practices to strengthen weak archetypes.

---

## What's Next

In Module 8, you'll clarify your purpose and mission—what you're here to do and how to pursue it.

**Before moving on:**
- Identify your strongest and weakest archetypes
- Begin practices to develop the weak ones
- Notice which archetypes you use daily

---

*The mature man isn't just one thing. He's King when order is needed, Warrior when action is required, Magician when insight matters, Lover when connection calls. He can be firm and tender, decisive and receptive, powerful and playful. This is integration—the full range of masculine energy, available and expressed.*
