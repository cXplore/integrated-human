## The Problem with Aggression

Modern men have a complicated relationship with aggression.

Some suppress it entirely—becoming passive, conflict-avoidant, and secretly seething. Others can't control it—exploding, hurting others, and then feeling shame.

Neither is healthy. Both rob you of your power.

**Aggression is life force. You need it. The question is: can you use it consciously?**

## What Aggression Actually Is

### Not Just Violence:
Aggression is forward-moving energy. The drive to act, assert, protect, create, and pursue.

### Healthy Aggression:
- Setting boundaries
- Protecting what matters
- Going after goals
- Speaking truth
- Sexual pursuit
- Healthy competition
- Physical power

### It's Not:
- Violence
- Abuse
- Losing control
- Domination
- Harm

---

## The Two Common Dysfunctions

### Suppression:
- Taught aggression is bad
- Shut it down
- Passive, conflict-avoidant
- Pleasing, nice
- Seething underneath
- Depression symptoms
- No power

### Explosion:
- Can't contain it
- Rage attacks
- Verbal or physical harm
- Shame after
- Cycle of explosion and regret
- Power that destroys

### Both Are:
Dysregulated aggression. Neither is conscious use of life force.

## Managing Explosive Aggression

### The Work:

**1. Recognize Triggers:**

- Body warning signs
- Patterns and predictors

**2. Intervene Early:**
- Catch it before explosion
- Pause, breathe, ground
- Remove yourself if needed

**3. Process the Backlog:**
- Old rage needs expression (safely)
- Therapy for underlying material
- Regular discharge so it doesn't build

**4. Build Regulation:**
- Nervous system work (Module 2)
- Capacity to hold intensity
- Response vs. reaction

**5. Make Amends:**
- Acknowledge harm done
- Commit to change
- Actions, not just words

Most aggression problems show up in relationships—with partners, kids, coworkers.

### The Practice:
- Pause before speaking when activated
- Express the energy elsewhere first

- Name what you need, don't attack
- Learn to fight clean (healthy conflict)

### What Partners Need:
To feel safe. Your aggression should protect, not threaten, your partner.

## Aggression and Purpose

### The Connection:
Aggression is the energy of going after something. Without it, you have no pursuit.

### For Purpose:
- Aggression to pursue your goals
- Power to overcome obstacles
- Assertion to claim what's yours
- Competition with self and others

### Healthy Aggression Enables:
A man who goes after what he wants without being destructive.

*Your aggression is not your enemy. It's your power. When you suppress it, you lose your fire. When it controls you, it destroys your life. The work is to reclaim it—to have access to this energy when you need it, to use it consciously, to let it serve what matters. A man without aggression is a man without power. A man controlled by aggression is a man who destroys. Reclaim yours.*
