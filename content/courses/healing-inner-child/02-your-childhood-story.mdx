## Telling Your Story

Healing begins with truth. Before we can heal what happened, we need to acknowledge what happened. This module guides you through remembering and telling your childhood story—not to blame, but to understand.

---

## Why Story Matters

### The Power of Narrative

Your story matters because:
- Naming what happened validates it
- Narrative creates coherence
- Understanding precedes healing
- What's hidden controls you
- Truth is the foundation

### Not About Blame

Telling your story is:
- Acknowledging reality
- Understanding impact
- Making sense of patterns
- Validating your experience

It's not:
- Blaming parents or others
- Making anyone a villain
- Dwelling in victimhood
- Defining your whole identity

---

## Approaching Memory

### Memory Is Complex

About memory:
- Some memories are clear
- Some are foggy or fragmented
- Some are emotional, not narrative
- Some are body memories
- Absence of memory is also data

### What You Do and Don't Remember

It's normal to:
- Have gaps in memory
- Remember emotionally but not factually
- Have memories surface later
- Not remember early years clearly
- Remember some things vividly

### Working With What You Have

Work with:
- What you remember
- What you were told
- Family stories
- Photos and objects
- Your body's knowing
- Emotional truth even without details

## The Emotional Truth

### Beyond Facts

Your story includes:
- Facts and events
- But also emotional truth
- How it felt
- What it meant to you
- The experience, not just the events

### Honoring Your Experience

Your experience matters:
- Even if others saw it differently
- Even if no single event was "that bad"
- Even if you have no "excuse"
- Your felt experience is valid

### Cumulative Impact

Sometimes:
- No single event was terrible
- But cumulative effect was
- Chronic emotional neglect is harmful
- Atmosphere matters as much as events

---

<Callout type="important">
Writing your story can bring up intense emotions. This is part of the process. If you find yourself overwhelmed, pause. Come back when you're ready. You don't need to write everything at once. Your story will continue to emerge as you work through this course.
