## The Past in the Present

Your childhood wounds don't stay in the past. They show up now—in your relationships, your reactions, your beliefs about yourself, your patterns of behavior. This module helps you connect your current struggles to their childhood roots.

---

## Patterns from Childhood

### How the Past Operates

Childhood wounds show up through:
- Triggers and reactions
- Relationship patterns
- Self-sabotage
- Core beliefs about yourself
- Automatic behaviors
- Emotional patterns

### The Invisible Connection

Often we don't see the connection:
- "Why do I always...?"
- "Why does this keep happening?"
- "I don't know why I react this way"
- The child is running the show, invisibly

### Making the Connection

Healing requires:
- Seeing the pattern
- Connecting it to its source
- Understanding the child's logic
- Bringing adult awareness

## Wounds in Relationships

### Relationship Patterns

Common patterns from childhood wounds:
- **Abandonment wound:** Clinging, jealousy, fear of being left, pushing away first
- **Rejection wound:** Hiding true self, people-pleasing, sensitivity to criticism
- **Shame wound:** Not letting people close, secrecy, feeling fundamentally flawed
- **Neglect wound:** Not expecting care, difficulty asking for help, invisible
- **Betrayal wound:** Difficulty trusting, hypervigilance, walls

### Choosing What's Familiar

We often:
- Choose partners who mirror wounding parents
- Recreate childhood dynamics
- Find ourselves in familiar pain
- The unconscious seeks what it knows

### Triggering Each Other

In relationships:
- Partners trigger each other's wounds
- Each becomes the other's "parent"
- Childhood dramas replay
- Understanding this helps break the cycle

<Exercise title="Relationship Patterns">

Map how wounds show up in relationships.

<Journal

• What patterns repeat across your relationships?
• How do your primary wounds show up with partners?
• Do you choose partners similar to your parents in any way?

## Wounds and Self-Worth

### Core Beliefs

Childhood wounds create beliefs:
- "I'm not lovable"
- "I'm not enough"
- "Something is wrong with me"
- "I'm bad"
- "I don't deserve good things"

### How They Operate

These beliefs:
- Feel like facts, not beliefs
- Operate unconsciously
- Filter all experience
- Confirm themselves
- Create self-fulfilling prophecies

### The Child's Logic

The child concluded:
- "If I'm not loved, I must be unlovable"
- "If I'm rejected, I must be wrong"
- "If this is happening, it must be my fault"

These conclusions felt true then. They aren't necessarily true now.

<Exercise title="Core Beliefs Examination">

Examine beliefs from childhood wounds.

<Journal
  id="hwsun-beliefs"
  prompt="Examine your core beliefs:

• What core beliefs do you hold about yourself?
• Where do these beliefs come from?
• How do they affect your life?
• What evidence exists against these beliefs?
• What would a different belief sound like?"
  placeholder="Core beliefs about myself:

## Emotional Patterns

### Chronic Emotional States

Wounds create emotional patterns:
- Chronic anxiety
- Depression
- Shame cycles
- Anger that surprises you
- Grief that won't resolve

### Emotional Triggers

You may be triggered by:
- Feeling abandoned or left
- Criticism or rejection
- Not being heard
- Conflict
- Vulnerability
- Success or good things

### Disproportionate Reactions

When reactions are too big:
- The present is touching the past
- The child is activated
- You're reacting to then, not now
- Adult context is lost

---

<Exercise title="Emotional Patterns">

Explore your emotional patterns.

<Journal
  id="hwsun-emotional"
  prompt="Examine your emotional patterns:

• What emotional states are chronic for you?
• What triggers disproportionate emotional reactions?
• Can you connect these to childhood wounds?
• When do you feel like a child emotionally?
• What would emotional regulation look like?"

## Coping Mechanisms

### How You Learned to Cope

As a child, you developed ways to cope:
- Numbing or dissociating
- Controlling
- People-pleasing
- Achieving
- Withdrawing
- Acting out
- Caretaking others
- Staying small

### Protective Functions

These coping mechanisms:
- Helped you survive
- Served a purpose then
- May be less useful now
- Are not failures—they worked

### Recognizing the Pattern

Now you can:
- See the coping as a pattern
- Understand its origin
- Appreciate its function
- Choose whether to continue

<Exercise title="Coping Pattern Mapping">

Map your coping mechanisms.

<Journal
  id="hwsun-coping"
  prompt="Explore your coping patterns:

• What coping mechanisms did you develop in childhood?
• How did each help you survive then?
• Which do you still use now?
• Which are now helpful? Which are harmful?
• What would healthier coping look like?"

## Body Patterns

### Wounds in the Body

Your body carries wounds:
- Chronic tension
- Posture patterns
- Health issues
- Nervous system dysregulation
- Somatic symptoms

### Where You Hold

Common holding patterns:
- Shoulder tension (burden, not protected)
- Chest constriction (heart protection)
- Belly tightness (not safe)
- Jaw clenching (suppressed expression)
- Shallow breath (fear, freeze)

### Connecting Body to Story

Your body tells the story:
- Tension relates to experience
- Patterns have origins
- The body remembers
- Healing includes the body

---

<Exercise title="Body Patterns">

Connect body patterns to childhood.

<Journal
  id="hwsun-body"
  prompt="Explore body patterns:

• Where do you hold tension chronically?
• What body symptoms are persistent?
• Can you connect body patterns to childhood experience?
• What is your body protecting or expressing?
• What would your body need to release?"

## The Map of Present Patterns

### Connecting Everything

Now you can see:
- Your patterns aren't random
- They connect to childhood
- The child is still active
- Understanding enables change

### The Purpose of This Map

This map helps you:
- See patterns clearly
- Not blame yourself for patterns
- Understand rather than judge
- Know what to work with

<Exercise title="Complete Pattern Map">

Create a complete pattern map.

<Journal

  prompt="Create your pattern map:

Connect your wounds to current patterns:

For each primary wound, list:
• The wound
• Related core beliefs
• Relationship patterns from this wound
• Emotional patterns
• Coping mechanisms
• Body patterns

## Key Concepts

- **The past in the present:** Wounds show up now through patterns
- **Relationship patterns:** Choosing familiar, triggering each other
- **Core beliefs:** Childhood conclusions that feel like facts
- **Emotional patterns:** Chronic states and disproportionate triggers
- **Coping mechanisms:** Survival strategies that may not serve now
- **Body patterns:** Where you hold what happened

<Callout type="important">
Seeing how the past operates in your present is powerful but can feel overwhelming. Remember: understanding patterns is the first step to changing them. You're not stuck. The child who created these patterns was doing their best. Now, the adult can make new choices.
</Callout>

*When you see the thread from then to now, you can begin to weave something new.*
