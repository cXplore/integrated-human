## Becoming Your Own Parent

Reparenting is the practice of giving yourself what you needed as a child. You become the parent you didn't have—the one who is present, protective, nurturing, and wise. This is the core of inner child healing.

---

## What Reparenting Is

### The Concept

Reparenting means:
- Providing for your inner child now
- Meeting needs that weren't met then
- Being the parent you needed
- Internal parenting, not external seeking

### The Shift

The shift is from:
- Seeking parenting from others → Providing it yourself
- Waiting to be cared for → Caring for yourself
- Child needing adult → Adult caring for child
- External dependency → Internal resourcefulness

### Not Replacing

Reparenting doesn't:
- Pretend original parents didn't fail
- Say you don't need others
- Mean you must do everything alone
- Make up for what happened completely

It does:
- Give you the internal resources you need
- Free you from seeking childhood needs externally
- Create internal stability
- Allow healthy adult relationships

## The Good Parent

### What Good Parenting Looks Like

The parent your child needed:
- Is present and attentive
- Provides safety and protection
- Offers unconditional love
- Validates feelings and experience
- Sets appropriate limits
- Guides without controlling
- Allows age-appropriate autonomy
- Celebrates and delights in the child

### The Parent You Can Be

You can become this parent:
- To your inner child
- Within yourself
- Not perfectly, but sufficiently
- Through practice and intention

## Reparenting Practices

### The Core Practice

Basic reparenting:
1. Notice when the inner child is activated
2. Acknowledge their presence and feelings
3. Offer what they need (presence, comfort, validation)
4. Speak to them as a good parent would
5. Provide internally what wasn't provided externally

### Daily Reparenting

Each day:
- Check in with your inner child
- Notice how they're feeling
- Offer what they need
- Speak kindly to yourself
- Make decisions that care for them

### In Triggering Moments

When triggered:
- Recognize the child is activated
- Pause and acknowledge them
- Offer comfort and safety
- Speak reassuringly
- Let the adult part lead

  rows={18}

## Meeting Specific Needs

### Reparenting for Safety

When the child doesn't feel safe:
- "I'm here to protect you"
- "You're safe now"
- "I won't let anything bad happen"
- "I'm the adult, and I've got this"

### Reparenting for Validation

When the child needs validation:
- "Your feelings make sense"
- "Of course you felt that way"
- "What happened to you was real"
- "I believe you"

### Reparenting for Love

When the child needs love:
- "I love you exactly as you are"
- "You don't have to be different"
- "There's nothing wrong with you"
- "You are lovable"

### Reparenting for Comfort

When the child needs comfort:
- "I'm here"
- "You can feel this"
- "I'm not going anywhere"
- "I've got you"

## The Inner Parent

### Developing the Part

Just as you have inner child parts, you can develop an inner parent:
- The nurturing, protective adult
- The one who provides
- The internal good parent
- This part may need development

### Strengthening the Parent

The inner parent grows through:
- Practice in reparenting
- Modeling (learning from others)
- Intentional development
- Your own healing
- Resources and knowledge

### When the Parent Is Weak

If your inner parent feels weak:
- Get support (therapist, mentor)
- Use external resources temporarily
- Learn what good parenting looks like
- Develop gradually
- Be patient with yourself

## Self-Care as Reparenting

### Daily Care

Reparenting includes caring for yourself:
- Adequate sleep (putting the child to bed)
- Nourishing food (feeding the child)
- Protection from harm (keeping them safe)
- Rest and play (allowing child's needs)
- Comfort when distressed (soothing)

### Making Good Decisions

Parent the child through choices:
- What's good for my inner child in this decision?
- Would a good parent let me do this?
- Am I taking care of myself?
- Is this nurturing or neglecting?

### Limits and Structure

Good parenting includes limits:
- Saying no to things that harm
- Creating structure
- Not letting the child run the show
- Adult wisdom alongside nurture

<Exercise title="Self-Care as Reparenting">

Apply reparenting to self-care.

<Journal
  id="ry-care"
  prompt="Examine self-care as reparenting:

• Where do you neglect your inner child in daily life?
• What would a good parent ensure you did/didn't do?
• What self-care practices would nurture your inner child?
• Where do you need better limits?
• What one self-care change would most serve your inner child?"
  placeholder="Where I neglect:

</Exercise>

## Reparenting in Relationships

### Not Seeking Parents in Partners

With reparenting:
- You don't need partners to be parents
- You can show up as an adult
- Needs are met internally
- Relationships become peer-to-peer

### Breaking the Pattern

When you reparent yourself:
- You don't project parent onto partner
- You don't become parent to partner
- You can relate adult-to-adult
- Healthier dynamics become possible

---

## Key Concepts

- **Reparenting:** Providing for your inner child now what wasn't provided then
- **The good parent:** Present, protective, loving, validating, guiding
- **Practices:** Daily check-ins, triggered moments, meeting specific needs
- **Inner parent development:** A part to strengthen and grow
- **Self-care as reparenting:** Daily care, good decisions, limits and structure
- **Relationships:** Not seeking parenting from partners

---

<Callout type="important">
Reparenting is ongoing, not one-time. The inner child will continue to need attention, especially in challenging times. This is not a burden—it's a relationship. The more you show up, the more the child heals, and the easier it becomes.
</Callout>

*You cannot change what happened. But you can give the child what they need now.*
