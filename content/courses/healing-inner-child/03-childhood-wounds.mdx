## Naming the Wounds

Wounds are what hurt you. They're the injuries—emotional, physical, psychological—that happened in childhood and still affect you today. This module helps you identify and name your specific wounds.

## Types of Childhood Wounds

### Wounds of Commission

Things that happened that shouldn't have:
- Physical abuse
- Emotional abuse
- Sexual abuse
- Verbal attacks
- Witnessing violence
- Chaotic environment

### Wounds of Omission

Things that didn't happen that should have:
- Emotional neglect
- Physical neglect
- Lack of attunement
- Not being seen
- Absence of affection
- Not being protected

### Both Are Real

Important to understand:
- Omission wounds are as real as commission wounds
- "Nothing bad happened" often means neglect
- What didn't happen matters
- Invisible wounds still wound

## The Impact of Wounds

### How Wounds Affect You

Childhood wounds create:
- **Core beliefs:** "I'm unlovable," "I'm not safe," etc.
- **Emotional patterns:** Anxiety, depression, shame
- **Relational patterns:** How you attach and relate
- **Coping mechanisms:** What you do to manage pain
- **Body holding:** Where pain is stored

### Wounds Shape Everything

Your wounds affect:
- How you see yourself
- How you relate to others
- What you believe you deserve
- What you fear
- What you do unconsciously

<Exercise title="Impact Assessment">

## Your Wound Map

### Bringing It Together

Create a comprehensive wound map:
- Your primary wounds
- Their sources
- Their impact on you now
- How they show up

### Not to Dwell, but to Know

The purpose of mapping:
- Awareness enables healing
- What's named can be addressed
- Understanding reduces shame
- This is preparation for healing

<Exercise title="Complete Wound Map">

<Journal
  id="cw-map"
  prompt="Create your wound map:

List your primary wounds and for each:
• What is the wound?
• What caused it?
• What beliefs came from it?
• How does it show up now?
• What part of you carries it?

Include as many wounds as are significant."

## Validation

### Your Wounds Are Real

Whatever your wounds:
- They are real
- They matter
- They affected you
- They deserve healing
- You're not making it up

### No Comparison

Don't compare:
- "Others had it worse"
- "It wasn't that bad"
- "I shouldn't complain"

Your wounds are yours. Comparison doesn't help healing.

### The Next Steps

With wounds identified:
- We can understand unmet needs
- We can see current patterns
- We can meet the inner child
- We can begin healing
- This map guides the work

<Callout type="important">
This module may bring up painful material. The wounds you've identified are real, and naming them can be activating. Take care of yourself. Use grounding practices. Reach out for support if needed. The healing comes later—this is the acknowledgment phase.

*What is named can be healed. You've begun to name it.*
