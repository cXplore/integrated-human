## First Contact

Now it's time to meet your inner child—not as concept, but as experience. This module guides you in developing an actual relationship with the young parts of yourself that still live within you.

## What Meeting Means

### More Than Metaphor

Meeting the inner child is:

- Building an ongoing relationship
- Not just thinking about childhood

### How It Works

The practice involves:
- Visualization and imagination
- Internal dialogue
- Feeling and sensing
- Developing connection over time

### What to Expect

You might:
- See images of your younger self
- Feel emotions of the child
- Hear words or messages
- Sense presence without seeing
- Feel resistance or nothing at first

All responses are valid.

## Building Relationship

### Ongoing Contact

One meeting isn't enough:
- Regular visits build trust
- The child learns to count on you
- Relationship deepens over time
- Make this an ongoing practice

### What Builds Trust

The child trusts when you:
- Return consistently
- Don't force or demand
- Listen without judgment
- Stay present with their pain
- Follow through on what you say

### Challenges in Relationship

You may encounter:
- A child who won't appear
- A child who's angry at you
- Resistance to connecting
- Overwhelming emotion
- Nothing happening

All of this is information. Work with it gently.

<Callout type="important">
Meeting your inner child can bring up strong emotions. The child has been waiting to be seen. When you finally show up, they may express years of feeling. Let this happen. You don't have to fix it immediately. Your presence is the medicine.

*The child you were has been waiting for you. Now, you have arrived.*
