## What You Needed

Behind every wound is an unmet need. Children have developmental needs that must be met for healthy development. When needs aren't met, we're wounded. Understanding your unmet needs is key to reparenting yourself.

## Universal Childhood Needs

### Every Child Needs

All children need:
- **Safety:** Physical and emotional security
- **Love:** Unconditional positive regard
- **Belonging:** Being part of the family
- **Being seen:** Recognized for who they are
- **Validation:** Their experience acknowledged
- **Guidance:** Appropriate structure and limits
- **Play:** Freedom for joy and exploration
- **Autonomy:** Age-appropriate independence

### Developmental Needs

At each stage, specific needs:
- **Infancy:** Bonding, consistency, safety
- **Toddler:** Exploration, boundaries, saying no
- **Childhood:** Competence, belonging, learning
- **Adolescence:** Identity, independence, meaning

## Your Primary Unmet Needs

### Identifying the Core

From your inventory:
- What needs were most unmet?
- What longing is strongest?
- What do you still hunger for?
- What's your deepest unmet need?

### The Need Behind the Wound

Each wound corresponds to need:
- Abandonment wound → Need for presence and stability
- Rejection wound → Need for acceptance
- Shame wound → Need for unconditional love
- Neglect wound → Need for attention and care
- Betrayal wound → Need for safety and trust

## How Unmet Needs Show Up Now

### Adult Manifestations

Unmet needs show up as:
- Intense longing for what was missing
- Overreaction when needs are touched
- Patterns of seeking what was lacking
- Difficulty receiving what you need
- Not knowing what you need

### Seeking in Wrong Places

We often:
- Look to partners to meet childhood needs
- Seek from others what we must give ourselves
- Put impossible expectations on relationships
- Get triggered when needs aren't met

### The Problem With Seeking

When we seek unmet childhood needs from others:
- No one can meet them fully (they needed to be met then)
- We exhaust partners and friends
- We repeat the frustration
- We stay in child position

• How do unmet childhood needs show up in your adult life?

## Needs vs. Wants

### Distinguishing Them

Needs are:
- Essential for wellbeing
- Universal to all children
- Not negotiable for development
- What was required then

Wants are:
- Preferences and desires
- Not essential for survival
- Can be traded off
- Less fundamental

### Legitimate vs. Illegitimate Needs

All childhood needs are legitimate:
- You weren't wrong to need
- The need wasn't the problem
- The failure to meet them was
- Don't shame yourself for needing

---

## Learning to Meet Your Own Needs

### The Reparenting Promise

Reparenting means:
- Giving yourself what you needed
- Becoming the parent you lacked
- Meeting your own needs now
- Not dependent on others for basics

### Can These Needs Be Met Now?

Some things can be met:
- Self-love and acceptance
- Self-validation
- Internal safety
- Being seen by yourself
- Play and joy
- Much of what you needed

Some things remain griefwork:
- What required a different childhood
- What can't be recovered
- The loss of what should have been

---

<Exercise title="Needs You Can Meet">

Identify needs you can meet now.

<Journal
  id="un-meet"
  prompt="Explore meeting your own needs:

• Which of your unmet needs can you meet now?
• What would it look like to give yourself safety?
• How could you validate yourself?
• How could you see and accept yourself?
• What needs require grieving rather than meeting?"

## Grieving What Wasn't

### Some Needs Can't Be Met Retroactively

You can't:
- Have a different childhood
- Go back and receive what wasn't given
- Undo what happened
- Pretend it didn't matter

### What Grief Offers

Grieving allows:
- Acceptance of loss
- Releasing the hope it will be different
- Moving forward without denial
- Honoring what should have been

### The Double Grief

You may grieve:
- What happened (commission)
- What didn't happen (omission)
- Both are losses
- Both deserve mourning

<Exercise title="Grieving Unmet Needs">

Begin grieving what wasn't.

<Journal

  prompt="Allow yourself to grieve:

• What do you need to grieve that can never be met?
• What childhood should you have had but didn't?
• What loss still lives in you?
• What would honoring this loss look like?
• What would you say to the child who needed so much?"

<Callout type="important">
It's painful to recognize what you needed and didn't get. This awareness can bring up grief, anger, and sadness. These feelings are part of healing. Let them move through you. What you needed as a child was legitimate. You weren't wrong to need.
</Callout>

---

*What you needed was real. What you didn't get mattered. Now, you can give yourself what you can.*
