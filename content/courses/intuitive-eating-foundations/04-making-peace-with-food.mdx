## Principle 3: Make Peace with Food

Give yourself unconditional permission to eat.

This is one of the most challenging principles—and one of the most transformative.

---

## The Forbidden Food Effect

When food is forbidden:
- It becomes more desirable
- You think about it more
- When you finally eat it, you eat more (might not get it again)
- Guilt follows, reinforcing the "bad" label

When food is truly allowed:
- It loses its special status
- You can take it or leave it
- You eat normal amounts
- No guilt, no drama

---

## True Permission

True permission isn't:
- "I'll allow it but I really shouldn't"
- "I can have it today but not tomorrow"
- "I'll eat it but I'll make up for it"

True permission is:
- "This food is available whenever I want it"
- "I can have it today, tomorrow, any time"
- "There's no making up for it—it's just food"

Your body knows the difference.

<Exercise title="Your Forbidden Foods">

Identify foods that carry charge for you.

<Journal

  prompt="List foods you consider 'forbidden' or 'bad':

THE FOODS:

What would happen if you truly allowed them?

What scares you about allowing them?"

IF I ALLOWED THEM:

WHAT SCARES ME:"

## Habituation

When you truly allow a forbidden food:

1. **Initial phase:** You might eat a lot of it (making up for deprivation)
2. **Habituation:** The food becomes less special
3. **Normalization:** It becomes just food, like any other
4. **Natural regulation:** You eat it in normal amounts when you want it

This process takes time—usually weeks to months per food.

---

## Practical Steps

To make peace:

1. **Pick one food** to start (moderately forbidden, not most charged)
2. **Stock it** — Have it available always
3. **Eat it when you want** — No strings attached
4. **Notice what happens** — Without judgment
5. **Give it time** — Habituation takes weeks

Repeat with other foods over time.

## Principle 4: Challenge the Food Police

The "food police" are the voices saying:
- "You shouldn't eat that"
- "That's bad for you"
- "You were so good today"

**Challenge them:**
- "According to whom?"
- "Says who?"
- "That's diet culture talking"
- "I can make my own decisions"

---

## Key Ideas

- Forbidden foods become more desirable
- True permission means no strings attached
- Habituation: allowed foods lose their charge over time
- Start with moderately forbidden foods
- Challenge the internal "food police"
- This is scary but transformative

*The foods you fear most often lose their power when truly allowed.*
