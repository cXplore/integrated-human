## Principle 8: Respect Your Body

Accept your genetic blueprint. It's hard to reject diet mentality while at war with your body.

This doesn't mean loving your body (that can come later). It means basic respect—treating your body with dignity.

## The Reality of Bodies

Bodies come in different sizes. This is genetic, not moral.

- Body size is 40-70% heritable
- Set point theory: bodies have a weight range they defend
- Weight is not a behavior—it's an outcome of many factors
- Health exists at many sizes
- You cannot determine health by looking at someone

## Body Respect vs. Body Love

**Body respect:** Treating your body with basic care and dignity
**Body neutrality:** Your body just is—not good, not bad
**Body acceptance:** Accepting what is, even if you don't love it
**Body appreciation:** Valuing what your body does for you
**Body love:** Genuinely loving your body

You don't have to love your body to respect it. Start with respect.

## Practical Body Respect

**Basic care:**
- Feeding it when hungry
- Resting when tired
- Moving in ways that feel good
- Medical care when needed

**Dignity:**
- Wearing clothes that fit NOW (not "goal" clothes)
- Speaking kindly about your body
- Not comparing to others
- Protecting it from harsh criticism (from self or others)

**Appreciation:**
- Noticing what it does for you
- Thanking it for functioning
- Acknowledging its resilience

## Weight Neutrality

Intuitive eating is weight-neutral:
- Weight is not the goal
- Weight is not the measure of success
- Your body will settle where it settles
- That might be higher, lower, or same as now

This is hard in a weight-obsessed culture. But it's essential for food peace.

## Key Ideas

- Bodies naturally come in different sizes
- You don't have to love your body—start with respect
- Practical respect: feeding, resting, comfortable clothes, kind words
- Intuitive eating is weight-neutral
- Your body will settle at its natural weight
- Accepting this is hard but necessary

*Your body has carried you through everything. It deserves basic respect.*
