## What Is Intuitive Eating?

Intuitive eating is an evidence-based approach to eating developed by dietitians Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch. It's not a diet—it's the opposite of a diet.

**Core premise:** Your body has innate wisdom about what, when, and how much to eat. Diet culture disconnected you from this wisdom. Intuitive eating helps you reconnect.

## The 10 Principles

Intuitive eating is organized around ten principles. Here's an overview:

### 1. Reject the Diet Mentality
Throw out diet books, unfollow diet accounts, stop hoping for a new diet that will finally work. Diets don't work long-term, and hoping for one keeps you stuck.

### 2. Honor Your Hunger
Keep your body fed with adequate energy. When you ignore hunger, you set up conditions for overeating later.

### 3. Make Peace with Food
Give yourself unconditional permission to eat. When food is forbidden, it becomes more desirable.

### 4. Challenge the Food Police
Silence the voices (internal and external) that declare you "good" for eating less and "bad" for eating more.

### 5. Discover the Satisfaction Factor
The Japanese have a concept: satisfaction is the hub of the eating experience. When you eat what you really want, satisfaction comes with less food.

### 6. Feel Your Fullness
Listen for signals that you're comfortably full. Pause mid-meal to check in.

### 7. Cope with Emotions with Kindness
Emotional eating is common. Find ways to comfort, nurture, and resolve emotions without using food as the only tool.

### 8. Respect Your Body
Accept your genetic blueprint. It's hard to reject diet mentality if you're unrealistic about body shape.

### 9. Movement—Feel the Difference
Focus on how movement feels, not calories burned. Find ways to move that you actually enjoy.

### 10. Honor Your Health with Gentle Nutrition
Make food choices that honor health and taste while making you feel good. You don't have to eat perfectly.

The principles aren't linear steps. They're interconnected aspects of a healthy relationship with food. You'll work on several simultaneously, and they'll deepen over time.

## Why This Order Matters

Notice that "gentle nutrition" is principle 10, not principle 1.

This is intentional. For people with diet history or disordered eating, focusing on nutrition too early:
- Becomes another set of rules
- Triggers old diet mentality
- Prevents true food freedom

You have to make peace with food FIRST. Then nutrition can be considered without it taking over.

## What to Expect

Intuitive eating is a process, not an event. Expect:

**Early stages:**
- Possible increase in eating (making up for restriction)
- Discomfort without food rules
- Anxiety about "eating too much"
- Excitement about food freedom

**Middle stages:**
- Foods losing their "forbidden" appeal
- More attunement to hunger/fullness
- Eating becoming less charged
- Weight may fluctuate (then stabilize)

**Later stages:**
- Food becomes just... food
- Eating takes up less mental space
- Body settles at its natural weight
- Nutrition can be considered without triggering

---

## This Is Not

Let's be clear about what intuitive eating is NOT:

- **Not a weight loss plan** (though bodies often settle at natural weight)
- **Not an excuse to eat without awareness**
- **Not "eat whatever you want, whenever you want" with no attunement
- **Not ignoring nutrition entirely**
- **Not for everyone** (some medical conditions require specific eating patterns)

It IS:
- A return to your body's wisdom
- A rejection of external diet rules
- A path to peace with food
- Evidence-based and well-researched

---

## The Research

Intuitive eating has solid research support:

- Associated with lower rates of disordered eating
- Linked to better body image
- Connected to improved psychological well-being
- Correlated with stable weight (not weight cycling)
- Associated with more variety in diet (better nutrition, ironically)

This isn't wishful thinking. It's science.
