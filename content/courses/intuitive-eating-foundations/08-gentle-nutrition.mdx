## Principle 10: Gentle Nutrition

Honor your health with food choices that feel good AND taste good.

This comes LAST for a reason. Nutrition considered too early becomes another diet. Once food peace is established, nutrition can be included without it taking over.

---

## Why Last?

For people with diet history:
- Nutrition rules easily become restrictions
- "Healthy" eating can mask disordered eating
- Food morality sneaks back in
- The relationship with food stays complicated

Once food is neutral, nutrition can be considered calmly.

---

## What Gentle Nutrition Is

**It IS:**
- Considering how foods make you feel
- Adding nutrients without subtracting pleasure
- Flexible, not rigid
- One factor among many
- Kindness to your body

**It ISN'T:**
- Calorie counting
- Eliminating food groups
- "Clean" eating
- Perfect eating
- The main factor in food choices

---

## The Both/And Approach

Gentle nutrition is both/and:
- Both nourishing AND enjoyable
- Both vegetables AND dessert
- Both nutrition AND satisfaction
- Both health AND pleasure

Not either/or.

## Practical Gentle Nutrition

**Addition, not subtraction:**
- Add vegetables to meals you enjoy
- Include fiber for satiety
- Eat regularly for stable energy

**Noticing how you feel:**
- Some foods give sustained energy, others crash
- Some foods digest easily, others don't
- Pay attention over time

**Flexibility:**
- No perfect eating required
- One meal doesn't make or break health
- Balance over time, not meal-by-meal

## When You're Ready

You're ready for gentle nutrition when:
- Food has lost its moral charge
- You can eat "unhealthy" food without guilt
- Hunger/fullness signals are clear
- You're not using nutrition as a diet in disguise
- Adding nutrition doesn't trigger restriction

If in doubt, wait. Food peace comes first.

---

## Going Deeper

This course covered foundations. For continued work:
- Read "Intuitive Eating" by Tribole & Resch
- Consider working with an IE-trained dietitian
- Practice over months—this is a long process
- Be patient with yourself

---

## Key Ideas

- Gentle nutrition comes last, after food peace
- It's both/and: nourishing AND enjoyable
- Add nutrients without subtracting pleasure
- Notice how foods make you feel
- Flexibility over perfection
- If nutrition triggers restriction, you're not ready yet
- This is a long-term practice, not a quick fix

*Nutrition matters. And so does pleasure, satisfaction, and peace. You can have all of it.*
