## Principles 2 and 6

Two principles work together:
- **Principle 2: Honor Your Hunger** — Keep your body fed with adequate energy
- **Principle 6: Feel Your Fullness** — Listen for signals of comfortable satisfaction

These are your body's most basic eating signals. Diet culture taught you to ignore them. Now we reclaim them.

## Honoring Hunger

Hunger is not the enemy. It's information.

When you let yourself get too hungry:
- Primal drive to eat kicks in
- Rational decision-making goes offline
- Overeating becomes almost inevitable
- The body doesn't trust it will be fed

**The solution:** Respond to hunger early, when it's gentle. Don't wait until you're ravenous.

## Types of Hunger

### Physical hunger
- Gradual onset
- Located in body (stomach, energy levels)
- Many foods sound good
- Eating satisfies it
- Stops when full

### Taste hunger
- Desire for a specific taste or texture
- Not necessarily physical need
- Valid—we eat for pleasure too

### Emotional hunger
- Sudden onset
- Often specific craving
- Located "above the neck"
- Eating doesn't satisfy the underlying need
- May lead to guilt

All types are information. None are "bad."

<Exercise title="Hunger Awareness">

Track your hunger for a day.

<Journal
  id="ief-hunger"
  prompt="For the next day, notice hunger:

MORNING:
When did you first feel hungry?
What type of hunger? How did you respond?

MIDDAY:
Same questions.

EVENING:
Same questions.

PATTERNS:
What did you notice?"
  placeholder="MORNING:

MIDDAY:

EVENING:

## Feeling Fullness

Fullness signals often get ignored when:
- You eat too fast
- You're distracted while eating
- You've disconnected from your body
- External cues override internal ones ("clean your plate")

**Reconnecting requires:** Slowing down, pausing mid-meal, asking "Am I still hungry? Am I satisfied?"

---

## The Fullness Check

Try this during meals:

1. **Start** — Notice hunger level (1-10)
2. **Midway** — Pause. Where are you now? Still enjoying the food?
3. **Decision point** — Continue? Stop? Have a bit more?
4. **After** — How do you feel? Satisfied? Stuffed? Still hungry?

No judgment. Just data collection.

---

## Permission Is Required

Here's the catch: you can only truly feel fullness if you trust you can eat again when hungry.

If part of you thinks "This might be my last chance to eat this," you'll eat past fullness—just in case.

Permission to eat + consistent feeding = ability to stop when satisfied.

---

## Key Ideas

- Hunger is information, not the enemy
- Respond to early hunger signals
- Different types of hunger: physical, taste, emotional
- Fullness requires slowing down and checking in
- You need permission to eat in order to feel fullness
- This is a practice—it develops over time

*Your body has been signaling hunger and fullness your whole life. You're just learning to hear it again.*
