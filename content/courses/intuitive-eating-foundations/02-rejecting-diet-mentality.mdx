## The First Principle

Principle 1 is foundational: **Reject the diet mentality.**

This isn't just about not dieting. It's about releasing the entire mindset that:
- You need external rules about eating
- Your body can't be trusted
- Weight loss = success
- Restriction = virtue

Until this mindset shifts, other principles can't take root.

## Why Diets Don't Work

The research is clear: diets don't work long-term for most people.

**The statistics:**
- 95-98% of diets fail within 2-5 years
- Most dieters regain the weight—and often more
- Weight cycling (yo-yo dieting) has its own health risks
- Dieting predicts future weight GAIN, not loss

This isn't because people lack willpower. It's because diets fight biology.

## Biology Fights Back

When you restrict food:

**Hunger hormones increase:**
Ghrelin (hunger hormone) rises significantly

**Fullness hormones decrease:**
Leptin (satiety hormone) drops

**Metabolism slows:**
Body conserves energy, burns less

**Food preoccupation increases:**
The brain becomes obsessed with food

**Binge tendencies increase:**
Eventually, the body demands compensation

This is survival programming. Your body thinks there's a famine and responds accordingly.

When you "fail" at a diet, you haven't failed. Your biology succeeded at keeping you alive. The diet failed YOU—it was never going to work long-term.

## The Diet Cycle

Diets create a predictable pattern:

1. **Hope:** "This diet will be different!"
2. **Restriction:** Following the rules
3. **Initial results:** Weight loss, sense of control
4. **Biology fights back:** Hunger, cravings, preoccupation
5. **"Failure":** Can't maintain, eat "forbidden" foods
6. **Shame:** "I have no willpower"
7. **Weight regain:** Often plus more
8. **Hope again:** "Maybe THIS diet..."

Each cycle often makes the next one harder. The body gets better at resisting restriction.

Reflect on your experience with diets.

WHAT DIETS HAVE COST YOU:

## The Diet Mentality

Diet mentality goes beyond formal diets. Signs include:

- Thinking of foods as "good" or "bad"
- Feeling virtuous when eating less
- Feeling guilty when eating more
- Looking for the next plan/reset/cleanse
- Compensating for eating (exercise, skipping meals)
- Believing you should eat less than your hunger says
- Comparing your eating to others
- Weighing yourself frequently

You can be "not on a diet" and still have full diet mentality.

## Letting Go

Rejecting diet mentality requires:

### Cognitive shift
Understanding that diets don't work—not because you failed, but because they're designed to fail.

### Behavioral shift
Stopping diet behaviors: calorie counting, restriction, "good" and "bad" food thinking.

### Environmental shift
Unfollowing diet accounts, getting rid of diet books, avoiding diet talk.

### Grief
Yes, grief. Letting go of the fantasy that the right diet will finally fix everything.

Where does diet mentality still show up?

THOUGHTS:
What diet-mentality thoughts do you still have?

BEHAVIORS:
What diet behaviors do you still engage in?

ENVIRONMENT:
What in your environment reinforces diet mentality?

If you fully released diet mentality?"

## The Fantasy

One of the hardest parts: letting go of the fantasy.

The fantasy says:
- "Once I lose weight, I'll be happy"
- "Once I control my eating, life will be better"
- "The right diet exists—I just haven't found it"
- "Thin = successful, healthy, lovable"

This fantasy dies hard. But it has to die for food peace to be possible.

## What's Left When Diets Go

Without diets, what's left?

- Your body's actual signals
- Eating based on hunger and satisfaction
- Food losing its moral charge
- Mental space currently occupied by food thoughts
- Energy currently spent on restriction
- A body that might not look how culture says, but functions for YOU

<Callout type="gentle">
Letting go of diets doesn't mean letting go of health. It means pursuing health through self-care rather than self-control, through attunement rather than rules.

## Practical Steps

To reject diet mentality:

1. **Delete diet apps** — MyFitnessPal, calorie trackers, weight trackers
2. **Unfollow diet accounts** — Social media cleanse
3. **Throw out diet books** — Or at least box them up
4. **Stop weighing yourself** — The scale reinforces diet mentality
5. **Notice diet thoughts** — When they arise, name them: "That's diet mentality"
6. **Avoid diet talk** — Change the subject when others diet-talk

---

## Key Ideas

- Rejecting diet mentality is the first and foundational principle
- Diets fail because biology fights restriction
- Diet mentality can persist even when not formally dieting
- Letting go requires cognitive, behavioral, and environmental shifts
- Grief is part of the process—letting go of the fantasy
- Rejecting diets isn't rejecting health—it's pursuing health differently

*Every diet you've "failed" is actually a diet that failed you. Your body was protecting you. It's time to stop fighting it.*
