# The Nervous System Reset Checklist

**A Quick-Reference Guide from Integrated Human**

---

## How to Use This Checklist

Your nervous system has three main states:
- **Ventral Vagal** (calm, connected, safe) ✓
- **Sympathetic** (fight/flight, anxious, activated) ↑
- **Dorsal Vagal** (freeze/shutdown, numb, collapsed) ↓

This checklist helps you:
1. Identify your current state
2. Apply the right intervention
3. Return to regulation

**Print this out. Keep it visible. Use it daily.**

---

## Part 1: Identify Your State

### Signs You're in Sympathetic (Fight/Flight) ↑

□ Racing heart or pounding chest
□ Shallow, rapid breathing
□ Muscle tension (jaw, shoulders, hands)
□ Feeling anxious, panicky, or on edge
□ Irritable, snappy, reactive
□ Mind racing, can't slow thoughts
□ Restless, can't sit still
□ Hypervigilant, scanning for threat

**If 3+ are checked, you're likely in sympathetic activation.**

---

### Signs You're in Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Shutdown) ↓

□ Feeling numb or disconnected
□ Foggy brain, can't think clearly
□ Low energy, heaviness, fatigue
□ Want to withdraw or hide
□ Feeling hopeless or flat
□ Dissociated, not quite "in your body"
□ Collapsed posture
□ Difficulty speaking or responding

**If 3+ are checked, you're likely in dorsal shutdown.**

---

### Signs You're in Ventral Vagal (Regulated) ✓

□ Breathing is easy and natural
□ Body feels relaxed but alert
□ Present and grounded
□ Can think clearly
□ Feel connected to yourself and others
□ Open, curious, engaged
□ Calm but not flat

**This is the goal. This is home base.**

---

## Part 2: Reset from Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)

**When you're activated, anxious, or agitated:**

### Immediate Interventions (1-2 minutes)

□ **Physiological Sigh**
   Double inhale through nose (full breath + small sip) → long exhale through mouth
   Repeat 3 times

□ **Extended Exhale Breathing**
   Inhale 4 counts → Exhale 8 counts
   Continue for 1-2 minutes

□ **Cold Water Reset**
   Splash cold water on face, or hold ice cubes
   Activates dive reflex, slows heart rate

□ **Orient to Safety**
   Look around slowly, name 5 things you see
   Feel your feet on the ground
   Notice: "I am safe right now"

---

### Short Interventions (5-10 minutes)

□ **Complete the Stress Cycle**
   Your body is mobilized for action—give it action:
   - Shake your body vigorously for 2-3 minutes
   - Do jumping jacks, run in place, push against a wall
   - Let the energy discharge

□ **Bilateral Movement**
   Walk briskly, alternating focus left-right
   Or: tap alternating knees while sitting
   Helps process and integrate activation

□ **Grounding Practice**
   5 things you see
   4 things you hear
   3 things you can touch
   2 things you smell
   1 thing you taste

---

### Longer Interventions (15-30 minutes)

□ **Slow Movement**
   Yoga, stretching, tai chi, slow walking
   Signal safety through deliberate, calm movement

□ **Nature Exposure**
   Go outside, preferably green space
   Natural environments cue safety to the nervous system

□ **Social Co-regulation**
   Connect with a calm, safe person
   Text, call, or be in their presence
   Regulated nervous systems help regulate yours

---

## Part 3: Reset from Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Shutdown)

**When you're collapsed, numb, or dissociated:**

### Immediate Interventions (1-2 minutes)

□ **Wake Up the Body**
   Rub your arms and legs briskly
   Splash cold water on face
   Press feet firmly into ground

□ **Sound Activation**
   Hum or sing (vibrates the vagus nerve)
   Play music—something with rhythm
   Speak aloud, even just describing what you see

□ **Change Position**
   Stand up if sitting
   Move to a different room
   Change your physical orientation

---

### Short Interventions (5-10 minutes)

□ **Gentle Activation**
   Don't jump to intense—build up slowly:
   - Stretch arms overhead
   - Roll shoulders
   - Gentle bouncing on feet
   - Gradually increase movement

□ **Temperature Change**
   Warm shower or bath
   Warm drink in hands
   Or: cold water on face/wrists (can be activating)

□ **Orient to Present**
   Look around the room slowly
   Name objects out loud
   Touch different textures
   Come back to "here and now"

---

### Longer Interventions (15-30 minutes)

□ **Social Connection**
   Text or call someone
   Even looking at photos of loved ones can help
   The social engagement system helps exit shutdown

□ **Gentle Movement**
   Walking (start slow)
   Dancing to music you love
   Yoga—nothing too demanding

□ **Vocalization**
   Sing along to music
   Read something aloud
   Have a conversation
   Sound activates the ventral vagal system

---

## Part 4: Daily Maintenance Checklist

**Do these regularly to keep your nervous system resilient:**

### Morning (pick 2-3)

□ Morning light exposure (10+ minutes)
□ Cold water at end of shower (30-60 seconds)
□ Breathwork practice (5 minutes)
□ Movement (yoga, walk, stretch)
□ No phone for first 30 minutes

### Throughout Day

□ Notice your state periodically (set reminders)
□ Take breathing breaks between tasks
□ Step outside at least once
□ Limit caffeine after noon
□ Eat regular meals (blood sugar affects regulation)

### Evening

□ Dim lights after sunset
□ No screens 60 minutes before bed
□ Wind-down routine (reading, stretching, bath)
□ Completion practice: "What's complete? What can I set down?"
□ Consistent sleep time

## Part 5: Quick Reference Card

*Cut this out and keep it with you:*

---

**FEELING ACTIVATED? (Anxious, racing, agitated)**

1. Physiological sigh (double inhale, long exhale) x3
2. Extend exhales: In-4, Out-8
3. Cold water on face
4. Name 5 things you see
5. Move: shake, walk, discharge energy

---

**FEELING SHUTDOWN? (Numb, foggy, collapsed)**

1. Rub arms and legs briskly
2. Change position, move to new spot
3. Hum, sing, or speak aloud
4. Gentle movement, gradually increase
5. Connect: text someone, look at photos

---

**DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLES:**

- Morning light
- Some form of movement
- Breathing practice
- Sleep hygiene
- One genuine human connection

## Remember

Your nervous system is not your enemy. It's doing its best to protect you based on what it learned.

The goal isn't to never get dysregulated—that's impossible. The goal is to:
- Notice when you've left regulation
- Have tools to return
- Gradually expand your capacity

Every time you successfully regulate, you're training your nervous system that it's safe to settle. This builds over time.

Be patient. Be consistent. Keep practicing.
