You didn't just grow up in a family. You grew up in a system. A web of relationships, unspoken rules, and assigned roles that shaped who you became.

Those patterns didn't end when you left home. They're running in your current relationships, your work, your sense of self.

## What is a family system?

A family is more than a collection of individuals. It's an interconnected system where:
- Everyone affects everyone
- Roles develop to maintain balance
- Unspoken rules govern behavior
- Patterns repeat across generations

## Common family roles

### The hero/golden child
The achiever. Makes the family look good. May carry impossible pressure and fear of failure.

### The scapegoat
The "problem child." Blamed when things go wrong. Often the honest one who expresses what the family suppresses.

### The lost child
The invisible one. Stays out of the way. May struggle with feeling unimportant.

### The mascot/clown
Provides relief through humor. Distracts from family tension.

### The caretaker
Takes responsibility for others' emotions or practical needs. Often cares for parent or siblings beyond appropriate for their age.

## How patterns persist

The role you learned becomes your template:
- The hero may become a workaholic perfectionist
- The scapegoat may continue feeling blamed
- The lost child may struggle to show up
- The caretaker may over-function in all relationships

The pattern persists until you see it.

## Breaking the pattern

### Step 1: See the pattern
What role did you play? What were the unspoken rules? What patterns repeated?

### Step 2: Separate past from present
When you react strongly, ask: "Is this about now, or then?"

### Step 3: Differentiate
Become your own person while staying connected. Have different opinions. Set boundaries without cutting off.

### Step 4: Grieve what wasn't
Acknowledge what you didn't get. This creates space to move forward.

### Step 5: Choose new patterns
Act differently than your conditioning. New behavior feels uncomfortable — that's not wrong, it's new.

## The integration

Understanding your family system isn't about blame. It's about clarity.

Your patterns make sense. They were adaptations. They might not serve you now.

Seeing clearly creates choice. That's freedom. That's growing up.
