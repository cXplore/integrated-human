Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate nearly everything: mood, energy, sleep, metabolism, reproduction, stress response, appetite.

What you eat directly influences hormone production, balance, and signaling.

This isn't about "hormone hacking." It's about supporting the body's natural hormonal intelligence through nutrition.

## The basics

### Hormones need building blocks

Hormones are made from nutrients. Without the raw materials, production suffers.

**Steroid hormones** (cortisol, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone) are built from cholesterol. Low-fat diets can impair their production.

**Protein hormones** (insulin, growth hormone) require amino acids from dietary protein.

**Thyroid hormones** need iodine, selenium, and tyrosine.

You can't make hormones without the ingredients.

### Fat is essential

Dietary fat isn't the enemy. It's essential for hormonal health.

Fat provides:
- Cholesterol for steroid hormone production
- Cell membrane integrity
- Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- Satiety signaling

Very low-fat diets often disrupt hormonal function—particularly reproductive and stress hormones.

### Blood sugar affects everything

Insulin is the master metabolic hormone. When blood sugar swings wildly, insulin follows—and pulls other hormones with it.

Chronic high insulin affects:
- Sex hormone balance
- Cortisol patterns
- Thyroid function
- Growth hormone
- Hunger hormones

Blood sugar stability is hormonal stability.

## Key hormonal systems

### Stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline)

**What they do:** Mobilize energy for threats, manage inflammation, regulate wake-sleep cycles.

**Nutritional support:**
- Adequate calories (undereating raises cortisol)
- Vitamin C (depleted during stress)
- Magnesium (calms the stress response)
- B vitamins (support adrenal function)
- Avoiding caffeine excess (stimulates cortisol)

**What disrupts them:**
- Chronic caloric restriction
- Skipping meals
- Excessive caffeine
- High-sugar diet
- Inadequate sleep

### Thyroid hormones

**What they do:** Set metabolic rate, energy production, temperature regulation.

**Nutritional support:**
- Iodine (seafood, seaweed, iodized salt)
- Selenium (brazil nuts, seafood)
- Zinc (meat, shellfish, pumpkin seeds)
- Adequate calories (undereating slows thyroid)
- Adequate carbohydrates (very low-carb can impair conversion)

**What disrupts them:**
- Severe caloric restriction
- Very low-carb diets long-term
- Iodine deficiency or excess
- Excessive raw cruciferous vegetables (goitrogens—usually only an issue with existing thyroid problems)

### Sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone)

**What they do:** Reproduction, libido, mood, muscle mass, bone health, and much more.

**Nutritional support:**
- Adequate fat (especially for testosterone)
- Cholesterol-containing foods
- Zinc (crucial for testosterone)
- Vitamin D
- Adequate protein
- Fiber (helps clear excess estrogen)

**What disrupts them:**
- Very low-fat diets
- Excess alcohol
- Chronic caloric deficit
- Too little protein
- Obesity (increases estrogen, lowers testosterone)
- Endocrine-disrupting chemicals in food packaging

### Insulin

**What it does:** Regulates blood sugar, stores energy, affects nearly all other hormones.

**Nutritional support:**
- Balanced meals with protein, fat, and fiber
- Complex carbohydrates over refined
- Regular eating patterns
- Avoiding sugar spikes

**What disrupts it:**
- High-sugar, refined-carb diet
- Large infrequent meals
- Lack of protein and fiber
- Chronic overeating

### Hunger hormones (leptin, ghrelin)

**What they do:** Signal hunger and fullness, regulate energy balance.

**Nutritional support:**
- Adequate protein (most satiating)
- Fiber-rich foods
- Regular meal timing
- Adequate sleep (crucial for leptin)
- Not chronic dieting

**What disrupts them:**
- Chronic restriction followed by overeating
- Sleep deprivation
- High-processed-food diet
- Leptin resistance from obesity

## Hormonal patterns through life

### Women's cycles

Hormonal needs shift through the menstrual cycle:

**Follicular phase:** May tolerate more carbohydrates, higher-intensity exercise.

**Luteal phase:** May need more calories, more magnesium, may crave carbohydrates.

**Menstruation:** Iron needs increase; anti-inflammatory foods help.

Eating enough is crucial. Undereating disrupts menstrual function.

### Menopause

Declining estrogen changes nutritional needs:
- Increased calcium and vitamin D for bone health
- Phytoestrogens may help symptoms (soy, flax)
- Anti-inflammatory diet for symptom management
- Adequate protein to preserve muscle

### Andropause

Declining testosterone in men:
- Adequate zinc and vitamin D
- Healthy fats
- Sufficient protein
- Weight management (excess fat converts testosterone to estrogen)
- Limiting alcohol

### Aging generally

As we age, hormones decline. Nutrition can support what remains:
- Adequate protein (need more with age)
- Vitamin D (synthesis declines)
- B12 (absorption decreases)
- Calcium (bone protection)

## Practical principles

### Eat enough

Chronic undereating is hormonal sabotage. The body interprets caloric deficit as famine and downregulates everything:
- Thyroid slows
- Reproductive hormones drop
- Stress hormones rise
- Hunger hormones dysregulate

If you're chronically fatigued with hormonal issues, you may simply not be eating enough.

### Include quality fats

Every day, include:
- Fatty fish (omega-3s)
- Olive oil
- Nuts and seeds
- Avocado
- Eggs (yolks included)

Don't fear fat. Fear its absence.

### Prioritize protein

Protein supports:
- Hormone production
- Blood sugar stability
- Satiety
- Muscle mass (which affects hormones)

Most people benefit from 0.7-1g per pound of bodyweight.

### Stabilize blood sugar

The single most impactful thing for hormonal health:
- Protein and fat at every meal
- Fiber-rich carbohydrates
- Avoid isolated sugars
- Regular eating pattern

When blood sugar is stable, hormones can stabilize.

### Reduce processed foods

Processed foods undermine hormones through:
- Blood sugar spikes
- Inflammatory seed oils
- Lack of nutrients
- Endocrine-disrupting packaging
- Additives affecting gut and metabolism

Whole foods support hormonal health.

### Manage alcohol

Alcohol disrupts:
- Sleep (affecting all hormones)
- Blood sugar regulation
- Liver function (where hormones are processed)
- Direct hormone production
- Gut health

Moderate or eliminate for hormonal optimization.

## Supplements for hormonal support

Some supplements may help, depending on individual needs:

**Vitamin D:** Most people are deficient. Crucial for hormone production.

**Magnesium:** Supports stress response, sleep, insulin sensitivity.

**Zinc:** Essential for testosterone and thyroid.

**Omega-3s:** Anti-inflammatory, support hormone signaling.

**Maca:** Traditional support for energy and libido (evidence mixed but promising).

**Ashwagandha:** May support cortisol regulation (some good evidence).

Always test before supplementing where possible. More isn't better.

## When to seek help

Nutrition supports hormonal health, but it's not a cure-all.

See a healthcare provider if you have:
- Persistent fatigue despite adequate rest and nutrition
- Menstrual irregularities
- Significant unexplained weight changes
- Low libido with other symptoms
- Symptoms of thyroid dysfunction
- Signs of insulin resistance

Hormone testing can guide intervention.

## The integration perspective

Hormones don't exist in isolation. They interact with:
- Sleep (crucial regulator)
- Stress (cortisol affects everything)
- Movement (regulates insulin, growth hormone)
- Relationships (oxytocin, testosterone)
- Meaning and purpose (affects stress hormones)

Nutrition is one piece. Integration means addressing the whole picture.
