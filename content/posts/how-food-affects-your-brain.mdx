Your brain is an energy hog.

It's only 2% of body weight but uses 20% of your energy. Every thought, every mood, every decision runs on fuel—and the quality of that fuel matters enormously.

What you eat doesn't just affect your body. It directly shapes how your brain functions.

## Brain basics

### What the brain needs

**Glucose:** The brain's primary fuel. It uses about 120g of glucose daily.

**Oxygen:** Delivered by blood—hence the importance of cardiovascular health.

**Fatty acids:** The brain is 60% fat. It needs omega-3s to maintain structure and function.

**Amino acids:** For neurotransmitter production.

**Vitamins and minerals:** Cofactors for thousands of reactions.

### The blood-brain barrier

The brain is selective about what it lets in. Not everything you eat crosses this barrier.

This protects the brain but also means some nutrients need active transport. Deficiencies at this barrier affect brain function.

### Neuroplasticity

The brain is constantly changing—making new connections, pruning unused ones. This requires energy and nutrients.

Good nutrition supports neuroplasticity. Poor nutrition impairs it.

## How specific nutrients affect the brain

### Omega-3 fatty acids

**Role:** Structural component of brain cell membranes. Anti-inflammatory. Supports synaptic function.

**Effects of deficiency:**
- Depression
- Cognitive decline
- Impaired memory
- Reduced learning capacity

**Effects of adequate intake:**
- Improved mood
- Better cognitive function
- Reduced brain inflammation
- Support for aging brain

The typical Western diet is dramatically low in omega-3s. Most people would benefit from more.

### Glucose and blood sugar

**Role:** Primary brain fuel.

**Effects of instability:**
- Brain fog during lows
- Irritability
- Poor concentration
- Impaired decision-making
- Long-term: increased dementia risk

**What helps:**
- Stable blood sugar throughout the day
- Complex carbs over simple
- Protein and fat with meals
- Regular eating patterns

### B vitamins

**Role:** Energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, homocysteine regulation.

**B1 (thiamine):** Severe deficiency causes brain damage. Mild deficiency impairs memory.

**B6:** Essential for serotonin and dopamine production.

**B9 (folate):** DNA synthesis, neurotransmitter production.

**B12:** Myelin production, neurological function. Deficiency causes cognitive decline, depression, and nerve damage.

### Iron

**Role:** Oxygen transport to brain, dopamine synthesis.

**Effects of deficiency:**
- Brain fog
- Fatigue
- Impaired attention
- Reduced cognitive performance

Iron deficiency is common, especially in women. But excess is also harmful—test before supplementing.

### Zinc

**Role:** Neurotransmitter function, neuroplasticity, immune function in brain.

**Effects of deficiency:**
- Depression
- Impaired learning
- Reduced attention
- Taste and smell changes

### Magnesium

**Role:** 300+ enzymatic reactions including brain function, NMDA receptor regulation, stress response.

**Effects of deficiency:**
- Anxiety
- Poor stress tolerance
- Sleep problems
- Brain fog

Many people are deficient. Signs often attributed to stress may be magnesium deficiency.

### Vitamin D

**Role:** Brain development, neuroprotection, mood regulation.

**Effects of deficiency:**
- Depression (especially seasonal)
- Cognitive decline
- Reduced executive function

Most people in northern latitudes are deficient for at least part of the year.

## Food and mood

### The serotonin connection

Serotonin—the "mood neurotransmitter"—is made from tryptophan (an amino acid from protein).

But production requires:
- Adequate tryptophan intake
- B vitamins (especially B6)
- Magnesium
- Carbohydrates (help tryptophan cross blood-brain barrier)

A diet deficient in any of these = impaired serotonin production = mood problems.

### The dopamine connection

Dopamine—motivation and reward—is made from tyrosine (another amino acid).

Production requires:
- Adequate protein
- Iron
- B vitamins
- Vitamin D

Chronic low dopamine = low motivation, depression, addiction vulnerability.

### Inflammation and mood

Chronic inflammation is increasingly linked to depression:
- Inflammatory cytokines affect neurotransmitter function
- Inflammation impairs neuroplasticity
- The "sickness behavior" response includes depression-like symptoms

An anti-inflammatory diet may directly improve mood.

## Food and cognition

### Acute effects

What you ate in the last few hours affects how your brain works now:
- Blood sugar stability affects focus
- Hydration affects cognition
- Recent meal composition affects alertness
- Caffeine affects attention (but also anxiety)

### Chronic effects

Long-term dietary patterns affect long-term brain health:
- Mediterranean diet associated with less cognitive decline
- Processed food diet associated with worse outcomes
- Chronic inflammation accelerates brain aging
- Nutrient deficiencies accumulate damage

### Brain aging

The brain ages, but rate of decline is modifiable:
- Omega-3s protect brain structure
- Antioxidants reduce oxidative damage
- Stable blood sugar protects against dementia
- Anti-inflammatory eating slows decline

What you eat in your 30s affects your brain in your 70s.

## Practical applications

### For mood

- Adequate protein (amino acids for neurotransmitters)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (fish or supplement)
- Stable blood sugar (regular meals, balanced macros)
- B vitamins (varied whole foods diet or supplement)
- Magnesium (leafy greens, nuts, or supplement)
- Vitamin D (sun, supplement, or fatty fish)

### For cognition

- Stable blood sugar (avoid spikes and crashes)
- Omega-3s (brain structure support)
- Antioxidants (colorful vegetables)
- Adequate hydration
- Caffeine strategically (not as crutch)

### For long-term brain health

- Mediterranean-style eating pattern
- Omega-3 fatty acids regularly
- Minimal processed food
- Colorful vegetables and fruits
- Stable blood sugar over time

## The takeaway

Your brain is what you eat—literally. Its structure is built from nutrients. Its function depends on adequate fuel.

This isn't about optimization or perfection. It's about giving the brain what it needs to function.

When the brain has what it needs, everything works better—mood, cognition, memory, regulation. When it doesn't, everything suffers.
