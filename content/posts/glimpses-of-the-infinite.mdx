Maybe it happened in meditation. Maybe on psychedelics. Maybe spontaneously—in nature, in crisis, in ordinary moments that became extraordinary.

The veil lifted. The sense of being a separate self dissolved. Time stopped. Everything was one—luminous, alive, infinite. You knew something you couldn't put into words. For a moment, you saw.

And then it passed.

You came back to ordinary life. Maybe you tried to explain it and couldn't. Maybe you doubted it. Maybe you've been chasing it ever since.

This article is about those glimpses—what they are, what they reveal, and how to integrate them rather than just pursue their return.

## The varieties of transcendent experience

The transcendent experience takes many forms:

**Unity consciousness**
The boundaries between self and world dissolve. There's no longer "you" experiencing "it"—there's just *this*, one undivided reality. Separation is revealed as illusion.

**Pure awareness**
All content drops away—thoughts, sensations, even the sense of being a person—and what remains is awareness itself. Empty yet full. Nothing yet everything.

**The void**
A confrontation with absolute emptiness. Terrifying and liberating in equal measure. The ground disappears, and you discover you don't need ground.

**Infinite love**
A love that has no object—just love itself, boundless, unconditional. The felt sense that existence is fundamentally benevolent.

**Timelessness**
The illusion of time collapses. Past and future are seen as mental constructs. Only the eternal now exists, and it contains everything.

**Ego death**
The sense of being a separate self completely dissolves. What you thought you were dies—and something far vaster is revealed to have always been present.

**Interconnection**
A profound recognition that everything is connected, that the web of existence is one living system, and you are both a strand and the whole.

These aren't different destinations. They're different flavors of the same fundamental recognition: what you really are is far vaster than the small self you've taken yourself to be.

## What the glimpse reveals

Regardless of the specific form, transcendent experiences tend to reveal consistent truths:

**You are not your thoughts**
Thoughts appear and disappear in something larger. That something—awareness—is what you are. Thoughts are weather; you are sky.

**You are not separate**
The sense of being a bounded individual is a functional illusion. In reality, there are no edges. What you call "you" bleeds into everything else.

**Now is all there is**
Past and future exist only as thoughts in this moment. The present is not a thin slice of time—it's the only reality.

**Death is not what you think**
When the self dissolves, you don't cease to exist—the sense of being a separate someone ceases. What you actually are cannot die because it was never born.

**Reality is sacred**
Not in a religious sense, but in the sense that existence itself is profound, meaningful, alive. The ordinary is revealed as extraordinary.

**Everything is already complete**
Nothing needs to be fixed, achieved, or attained. What's here is already whole, already enough.

These truths feel obvious in the glimpse. They can feel like remembering rather than learning—as if you always knew this but had forgotten.

## The problem with glimpses

Here's the difficulty: glimpses pass.

You taste the infinite. Then you return to the finite. Bills, relationships, traffic, anxiety—the ordinary world of apparent separation.

And often, something goes wrong:

**The spiritual ego**
The glimpse becomes a trophy. "I've seen things others haven't." Specialness arises. The same ego that dissolved now inflates around having dissolved.

**The golden past**
You spend years trying to recreate the experience. Every meditation is compared to that one time. The present moment is never enough because it's not *that*.

**Spiritual bypassing**
You use the glimpse to avoid ordinary human challenges. "I've seen through the self, so I don't need to work on my attachment issues." The glimpse becomes a hiding place.

**Meaninglessness**
Sometimes returning to ordinary life after transcendence creates nihilism. "If all this is illusion, what's the point?" The glimpse destabilizes without integrating.

**Spiritual addiction**
Chasing peak experiences becomes a compulsion. More retreats, more substances, more practices—anything to get back there. The chase itself becomes the prison.

The glimpse was real. The insight was valid. But the relationship with it can become dysfunctional.

## What the glimpse points to

The glimpse isn't meant to be a destination. It's meant to be a pointer.

It shows you: *This is possible. This is what you actually are.*

Then it releases you back into life—not to pine for it, but to integrate it. To let the glimpse inform how you live, not just how you felt that one time.

What the glimpse points to is not an experience—it's a recognition.

Experiences come and go. The transcendent experience came and went.

But what was *revealed* in the experience? That's still here.

- Awareness is still here.
- This moment is still here.
- The interconnection is still true.
- The self is still an appearance.

The glimpse showed you something about reality that remains true even when the feeling fades. The work is to live from that understanding, not to recreate that feeling.

## Integration over repetition

The mature response to glimpses isn't chasing more glimpses. It's integration.

**Integration means:**

*Living from the recognition rather than for the experience.*

The glimpse showed you that you're awareness? Okay—be awareness now, in this ordinary moment, without fireworks.

The glimpse showed you interconnection? Let that inform how you treat others today, without needing to feel the overwhelming oneness again.

The glimpse showed you that thoughts aren't who you are? Notice that now, with these ordinary thoughts, without special states.

**Integration asks:**

- What did this experience reveal about reality?
- How does that change how I live?
- What would it look like to embody this understanding in ordinary life?
- How can I stabilize the insight rather than repeat the experience?

## The ordinary is the extraordinary

Here's what sustained practice reveals: the extraordinary isn't elsewhere.

Those moments of transcendence showed you the truth of this moment—any moment. The luminosity you experienced wasn't imported from somewhere else; it was this reality, seen clearly.

Which means: it's available now.

Not as a peak experience—but as a recognition, a seeing, a being.

Right now:
- Awareness is present
- Sounds are appearing
- Sensations are occurring
- The mystery of existence is here

This is the same reality that was revealed in the glimpse. The only difference is how clearly you're seeing it.

The goal isn't to get back to the extraordinary. It's to recognize the extraordinary that's always here—hidden in plain sight as the ordinary.

## Practice after glimpses

How do you work with glimpses skillfully?

**1. Don't cling, don't dismiss**

The glimpse was real. Don't gaslight yourself into thinking it was "just brain chemistry" or meaningless. It revealed something.

And: don't make it into a spiritual prison. Don't compare every moment to it. Let it inform you without haunting you.

**2. Extract the understanding**

What did the glimpse show you about reality? Get clear on this—not the feelings, but the insights.

Write it down. Return to it. Let the understanding mature even as the experience fades.

**3. Look for it here**

Whatever was revealed in the glimpse is still true now. Can you find awareness now? Can you sense interconnection now? Can you recognize the illusion of separation now?

The glimpse happened in extraordinary circumstances. The truth it revealed is always true.

**4. Let it humble you**

The glimpse showed you how little you know. How limited the ordinary mind is. How vast reality actually is.

Let that humble you rather than inflate you. You saw something—and you barely understood it. There's more to see. Stay curious.

**5. Serve from it**

The deepest integration is service.

If you've tasted unity, how does that change how you treat others? If you've seen through separation, what does that demand of your life?

The insight isn't meant to be hoarded. It's meant to be lived, shared, embodied in the world.

## When glimpses don't come

Some people have dramatic transcendent experiences. Others don't.

Both paths are valid.

The gradual path—slow, steady recognition without fireworks—is just as authentic as the dramatic path. Sometimes more stable, actually. Less to integrate. Fewer extremes.

If you've never had a glimpse:
- You're not doing something wrong
- You're not spiritually inferior
- The truth is still available to you

Look at what's here. Ask what's aware. Rest in presence. The same recognition can arise without the drama.

And if glimpses have come: great. But they're not the point. Living the recognition is the point.

## Coming home

The glimpse of the infinite is ultimately a glimpse of home.

Not a foreign place—but what you've always been, finally noticed. The transcendent experience is only transcendent relative to where you thought you were standing. In truth, it's the most intimate, most obvious, most ordinary recognition.

You are awareness.
You have always been awareness.
The glimpse didn't create this—it revealed it.

And now? Now you live from what was revealed.

Not chasing the feeling. Not dismissing the insight. But letting the glimpse of the infinite become the ground of a finite life lived fully—with all its mess, all its challenge, all its beauty.

That's the invitation: integrate, embody, serve.

Let the glimpse of the infinite become an infinite life.
