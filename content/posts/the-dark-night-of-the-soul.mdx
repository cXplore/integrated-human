There's a phase on the spiritual path that's been described for centuries: the dark night of the soul.

It's not depression, though it may include it. It's not failure, though it feels like it. It's a specific crisis that can arise in the process of spiritual development—and it's strangely common.

Understanding what it is can help navigate when you're in it.

## What the dark night is

The term comes from St. John of the Cross, a 16th-century mystic, who described a period of profound spiritual darkness—loss of connection to God, loss of spiritual comfort, loss of the sense of self.

In more contemporary language, the dark night is:

- The collapse of spiritual identity
- The falling away of what gave life meaning
- Intense existential dislocation
- Loss of familiar sense of self
- Profound doubt about the path
- The death of illusions—including spiritual ones

It's not the same as depression (though they can overlap). It's specifically tied to spiritual development and the dissolution of ego structures.

## What triggers it

The dark night often comes after spiritual progress:

### After awakening experiences

A glimpse of true nature can be followed by its opposite—complete absence of connection, meaning, and grace.

### During ego dissolution

As the ego structure breaks down, there's a period of disorientation before new stability forms.

### The loss of the spiritual self

Ironically, the "spiritual identity"—the meditator, the seeker, the good practitioner—may need to die too. This loss can trigger the dark night.

### Exhaustion of seeking

Sometimes the endless search for something spiritual just exhausts itself. Everything that was sought collapses as meaningful.

### Life crises

Major losses—death, divorce, illness—can trigger dark nights, especially if spiritual frameworks collapse in the process.

## Characteristics of the dark night

### Loss of meaning

Things that used to matter don't. Spiritual practices feel empty. Life feels meaningless. There's no sense of purpose or direction.

### Spiritual absence

Where there was once a sense of connection—to God, to source, to life—there's now absence. Meditation brings nothing. Prayer is empty.

### Existential terror

The foundations of identity are shaking. Who am I? Why am I here? What is any of this? These questions become visceral, not philosophical.

### Profound loneliness

A sense of being utterly alone, even around others. No one understands. No one can help. Isolation even from the divine.

### Depression-like symptoms

Low energy, loss of interest, hopelessness. But with a quality of spiritual crisis rather than purely psychological depression.

### Death of the old self

Something is dying—the old identity, the old way of making sense of things. Before the new emerges, there's the dying.

## What the dark night is NOT

### Just depression

Clinical depression and dark night can coexist and overlap. But dark night has a specific spiritual character—it's tied to the dissolution of identity and meaning structures.

Treatment for depression (therapy, medication) may be appropriate. But the dark night also requires a spiritual framework for understanding.

### Punishment

It's not that you've done something wrong or failed spiritually. The dark night is a common phase on the path, described by mystics across traditions.

### Abandonment by God

In theistic terms, it may feel like God has abandoned you. Mystics suggest the opposite—it's actually a deepening of the spiritual path, even though it feels like loss.

### Forever

Though it feels eternal, the dark night passes. It's a phase, not a final destination.

## What's actually happening

Seen from outside the experience, the dark night is often:

### Purification

Old structures of identity, old ways of seeking, old attachments to spiritual experience—all being cleared out.

### Deepening

The absence of spiritual comfort can be a deepening beyond dependence on states and experiences.

### Ego death

The separate self—including the spiritual self—is dissolving. This is precisely what's been sought, but it doesn't feel like achievement.

### Transition

Between the old way of being and the new, there's the in-between. The dark night is that transition.

## How to navigate

### Allow it

Don't try to fix it immediately. Something is happening. Resistance often prolongs it.

### Get support

This is too much to navigate alone. Find someone who understands spiritual crises—a teacher, therapist, or guide who can hold space.

### Distinguish from depression

If symptoms are severe, get appropriate mental health support. The dark night doesn't preclude treatment; it may require it.

### Don't make big decisions

If possible, avoid major life decisions during the dark night. Everything is distorted. Wait for clarity.

### Minimal practice

You may not be able to practice as you did before. That's okay. Do the bare minimum—whatever keeps you going.

### Self-care

Basic physical care—sleep, food, gentle movement, nature. The body needs tending even when the spirit is in crisis.

### Surrender

At some point, the dark night invites complete surrender. Not giving up, but giving over. Letting go of control, of understanding, of needing this to be different.

### Trust the process

Easy to say, hard to feel. But mystics across traditions have walked this path. It has an end. Something new emerges.

## The other side

People who have passed through dark nights often report:

- Deeper, more stable awakening
- Freedom from dependence on spiritual states
- Authentic groundedness
- Compassion for others' suffering
- Simpler, clearer sense of what's real
- Humility

The dark night, though terrible, is often a crucial phase in genuine transformation. Not a detour but the path itself.

## A note

If you're in a dark night right now:

You're not alone, even if it feels that way. This is a known territory of the path. Others have passed through. The darkness does end. What's dying needs to die. What's coming can't be forced.

Seek help if you need it. This isn't something to endure in silence.

And—impossible as it may feel—trust. Something is being worked out in the darkness.
