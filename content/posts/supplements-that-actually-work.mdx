Most supplements don't work.

The supplement industry is largely unregulated. Companies can make vague claims, use ineffective doses, include fillers, and sell you hope in a bottle.

But some supplements have real evidence. Here's how to separate the signal from the noise.

## The foundation: Why supplementation sometimes makes sense

- Modern food is less nutrient-dense than it was
- Soil depletion affects mineral content
- Most people don't eat enough variety
- Specific situations (stress, athletics, pregnancy, aging) increase needs
- Some nutrients are hard to get from food alone

Supplements don't replace good nutrition. They supplement it. The name is literal.

## Tier 1: Strong evidence, most people benefit

### Vitamin D

**The reality**: Most people are deficient, especially in northern latitudes, during winter, if dark-skinned, or if indoors.

**The benefits**: Bone health, immune function, mood, hormone production, inflammation reduction.

**The dose**: 1,000-5,000 IU daily depending on baseline levels. Test and adjust.

**The form**: D3 (cholecalciferol), preferably with K2 and fat for absorption.

### Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)

**The reality**: Modern diets are severely imbalanced toward omega-6. This promotes inflammation.

**The benefits**: Brain health, mood, inflammation reduction, cardiovascular health, joint health.

**The dose**: 1-3g combined EPA/DHA daily. Higher for specific conditions.

**The form**: Triglyceride form fish oil, tested for purity. Or algae-based for vegetarians.

### Magnesium

**The reality**: Estimated 50%+ of people are deficient. It's depleted by stress, alcohol, and many medications.

**The benefits**: Sleep, stress response, muscle function, blood pressure, hundreds of enzymatic processes.

**The dose**: 200-400mg elemental magnesium daily.

**The form**: Glycinate or threonate for brain/relaxation, citrate for general use and bowel regularity. Not oxide (poor absorption).

### Creatine

**The reality**: One of the most studied supplements. Works.

**The benefits**: Strength, power, muscle mass, cognitive function (especially under stress or sleep deprivation).

**The dose**: 3-5g daily. No loading phase needed.

**The form**: Creatine monohydrate. Don't pay extra for fancy forms.

## Tier 2: Good evidence, specific populations

### Vitamin B12

**Who needs it**: Vegans/vegetarians (essential), people over 50, those on certain medications (metformin, PPIs).

**The dose**: 500-1000mcg daily or 2500mcg weekly.

**The form**: Methylcobalamin or cyanocobalamin.

### Iron

**Who needs it**: Menstruating women, vegetarians, endurance athletes, people with diagnosed deficiency. NOT everyone.

**Warning**: Don't supplement without testing. Excess iron is dangerous.

### Zinc

**Who needs it**: Vegetarians (plant zinc is less bioavailable), people who sweat heavily, those with digestive issues, men focused on testosterone.

**The dose**: 15-30mg daily with food.

**Warning**: Too much zinc depletes copper. Balance matters.

### Protein powder

**Who needs it**: Those not meeting protein needs through food, especially athletes and older adults.

**The reality**: It's just food in convenient form. Not magical, but useful.

### Melatonin

**Who needs it**: Short-term for jet lag or circadian disruption. Not as a permanent sleep crutch.

**The dose**: Start low (0.3-0.5mg). More isn't better.

## Tier 3: Promising but not conclusive

### Ashwagandha

**The research**: Decent evidence for stress reduction, cortisol lowering, and possibly testosterone.

**The caveat**: Quality varies wildly. Get standardized extracts.

### Curcumin

**The research**: Strong anti-inflammatory effects in studies.

**The problem**: Terrible absorption. Needs piperine or lipid formulation.

### NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)

**The research**: Supports glutathione production, shows promise for mental health, liver support.

**The reality**: Worth trying for specific purposes. Not universally needed.

### Probiotics

**The research**: Strain-specific benefits are real. But which strain, for what condition, is complex.

**The problem**: Most commercial probiotics are random strains with no evidence they do anything.

## What's probably not worth your money

### Multivitamins

Most use forms your body can't absorb, in doses too low to matter. Expensive pee.

If you want a multivitamin, get a quality one. Otherwise, target specific deficiencies.

### BCAAs

If you eat adequate protein, you get enough BCAAs. Waste of money for most people.

### Testosterone boosters

Most "natural testosterone boosters" do nothing measurable. The ones that work are basically steroids labeled differently.

### Fat burners

Mostly caffeine with marketing. If they worked well, everyone would be lean.

### Collagen for joints

Evidence is weak. Save for skin benefits maybe, but don't expect it to rebuild cartilage.

## How to buy supplements

### Red flags:
- Proprietary blends (hiding doses)
- Outrageous claims
- No third-party testing
- Too many ingredients
- Celebrity endorsements

### Green flags:
- Third-party tested (NSF, USP, ConsumerLab, Informed Sport)
- Doses match research
- Transparent labeling
- Company reputation
- No BS claims

## The bottom line

Supplements can help, but:

1. Fix your diet first. No supplement fixes a bad diet.
2. Prioritize sleep, movement, stress management.
3. Test before supplementing when possible.
4. Buy quality or don't bother.
5. Less is more. Target actual needs.

The supplement industry wants you to buy everything. Your body just needs the gaps filled.
