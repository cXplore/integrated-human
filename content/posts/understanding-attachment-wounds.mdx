The way you love—and the way you struggle to love—was shaped long before you had any choice in the matter. Your earliest relationships created templates that you're likely still following, often without knowing it.

These are attachment wounds: injuries to your fundamental sense of safety, worthiness, and connection that continue to affect how you relate to others.

## What Attachment Wounds Are

Attachment wounds develop when childhood needs for safety, attunement, and consistent care aren't adequately met.

This doesn't require obvious trauma. It can happen through:

- Emotional unavailability of caregivers
- Inconsistent responsiveness
- Misattuned connection
- Rejection or criticism
- Neglect or abandonment
- Unpredictability or chaos
- Enmeshment or boundary violation

The child's developing sense of self and other gets shaped by these experiences. Patterns form that persist into adulthood.

## Common Wound Patterns

### The Abandonment Wound

**Origin:** Caregiver was physically or emotionally absent, unpredictably available, or left.

**Core belief:** "People I love will leave me."

**Pattern:** Hypervigilance about rejection. Interpreting ambiguous signals as abandonment. Clinging or preemptively leaving. Difficulty trusting reliability.

**Paradox:** The fear of abandonment often creates the very behavior that pushes people away.

### The Rejection Wound

**Origin:** Caregiver was critical, disapproving, or conditionally loving.

**Core belief:** "I'm not good enough to be loved."

**Pattern:** Perfectionism to earn love. Hiding true self. Fear of being seen. Assuming rejection. Withdrawing before being rejected.

**Paradox:** Hiding yourself prevents the authentic connection you long for.

### The Enmeshment Wound

**Origin:** Caregiver was intrusive, didn't respect boundaries, used child for their own emotional needs.

**Core belief:** "I exist for others' needs, not my own."

**Pattern:** Losing self in relationships. Difficulty knowing what you want. Feeling responsible for others' emotions. Guilt about separateness.

**Paradox:** Over-giving creates resentment and exhaustion that damages relationships.

### The Neglect Wound

**Origin:** Needs weren't seen or met. Child was invisible, parentified, or not a priority.

**Core belief:** "My needs don't matter. I'm too much."

**Pattern:** Difficulty asking for needs. Not knowing what you need. Minimizing your own importance. Choosing unavailable partners.

**Paradox:** Not expressing needs ensures they won't be met.

### The Trust Wound

**Origin:** Caregiver was unsafe, deceptive, or betrayed trust.

**Core belief:** "I can't trust anyone. People will hurt me."

**Pattern:** Walls and defenses. Testing partners. Difficulty with vulnerability. Expecting betrayal.

**Paradox:** Walls that protect from hurt also prevent genuine connection.

## How Wounds Show Up in Adult Relationships

Attachment wounds create characteristic patterns:

**Partner selection.** You're often drawn to people who activate your wounds—the unavailable ones if you have abandonment wounds, the critical ones if you have rejection wounds. Familiarity feels like attraction.

**Triggered reactions.** Small events trigger big responses because they echo old wounds. A delayed text isn't just a delayed text—it's confirmation of abandonment.

**Self-sabotage.** Unconsciously creating what you fear. Pushing away love to avoid being abandoned. Hiding to avoid rejection.

**Repetition.** Playing out the same dynamics across relationships. Different faces, same pattern.

**Difficulty with secure love.** When someone is genuinely available and loving, it feels wrong, boring, or suspicious. The nervous system doesn't recognize safety.

## Beginning to Heal

### 1. Recognize Your Patterns

What wounds do you carry? What beliefs formed? What patterns repeat?

This isn't about blame—it's about understanding. You can't heal what you won't see.

### 2. Connect Past to Present

When you're triggered in a relationship, ask: "What old wound is this touching?" The current person may have touched the wound, but the size of the reaction often comes from the past.

### 3. Grieve What Happened

You didn't get what you needed. That's a loss. Grieving that loss—rather than staying angry or numb—is part of healing.

### 4. Differentiate Then from Now

The past happened in specific circumstances with specific people. Now is different. Current relationships aren't the same as the original wounding ones.

"My partner is not my parent" is simple but powerful.

### 5. Take Risks in Safe Relationships

Healing happens in relationship. Finding people who respond differently than the original wound-creators and allowing yourself to experience that difference.

This requires vulnerability—exactly what the wound makes terrifying.

### 6. Therapy

Attachment wounds often benefit from professional support. Therapists trained in attachment can help you understand patterns, experience corrective relationship, and rewire old templates.

## The Long Path

Attachment wounds don't heal quickly. They developed over years of repetition; they shift through years of different experiences.

But they do heal. The template can change. People with deep attachment injuries develop secure relationships. The nervous system learns that safety is possible.

This happens through:
- Awareness of patterns
- Safe relationships (therapeutic and otherwise)
- Practice taking different actions
- Patience with setbacks
- Gradual rewiring of expectations

## What You're Working Toward

Earned secure attachment—the capacity for trusting, stable, connected relationships developed through conscious work rather than fortunate childhood.

Signs of healing:
- Relationships feel less like survival
- You can tolerate ambiguity without spiraling
- You can be vulnerable without being overwhelmed
- You can ask for needs without shame
- You can let people be separate without abandonment panic
- You can let people close without engulfment fear

This is possible. Many people get there. It's not about having perfect relationships—it's about having enough security that relationships are workable.

## Starting Point

If this resonates: you're not broken. You're carrying adaptations from childhood that made sense then but limit you now.

Naming the wound is the first step. "This is my abandonment wound. This is my rejection pattern."

That naming creates distance. You have the wound—you are not the wound.

And from that distance, change becomes possible.
