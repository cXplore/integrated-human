You've heard it all. Dark room. Cool temperature. No screens before bed. Consistent schedule.

And maybe you're still not sleeping well.

Here's what to try when the basics aren't enough.

## Why sleep matters more than you think

Sleep isn't just rest. It's when your brain:
- Clears metabolic waste (including amyloid plaques linked to Alzheimer's)
- Consolidates memories and learning
- Processes emotions
- Repairs and regenerates tissue
- Regulates hormones that control appetite, stress, and growth

One night of poor sleep affects insulin sensitivity, emotional regulation, cognitive performance, and immune function. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to nearly every major health problem.

Sleep isn't a luxury. It's foundation.

## The circadian system

Your body runs on a roughly 24-hour cycle, controlled by:
- **Light exposure** (the most powerful signal)
- **Temperature**
- **Eating timing**
- **Activity patterns**
- **Social cues**

When these signals are consistent, sleep comes easily. When they're chaotic, so is your sleep.

## Light: The master signal

### Morning light is crucial

Get bright light (ideally sunlight) within 30-60 minutes of waking:
- 10-30 minutes depending on brightness
- Even cloudy days are much brighter than indoor light
- Face toward the sun (don't stare at it)
- No sunglasses

This sets your circadian clock and triggers cortisol release at the right time.

### Evening light is equally important

Reduce light 2-3 hours before bed:
- Dim overhead lights significantly
- Use warm-colored, low lamps
- Blue-light blocking glasses if you must use screens
- Consider red or amber lights for evening

Bright light in the evening delays melatonin release and shifts your clock later.

### The contrast matters

Your circadian system responds to the difference between day and night light. If you're inside all day in dim light, then in bright artificial light at night, your body can't tell day from night.

Maximize daytime light. Minimize evening light. The contrast is the signal.

## Temperature

Your body needs to drop core temperature by about 1-2 degrees to initiate sleep.

**What helps:**
- Cool bedroom (65-68°F / 18-20°C)
- Hot bath or shower 1-2 hours before bed (paradoxically, this helps you cool down faster)
- Breathable bedding
- Feet slightly cool (but not cold)

**What hurts:**
- Too-warm room
- Heavy blankets when you're already warm
- Exercise too close to bed (raises core temp)
- Eating large meals late (digestion generates heat)

## The timing of everything

### Eating

- **Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed.** Digestion interferes with sleep quality.
- **Avoid alcohol.** It helps you fall asleep but destroys sleep architecture. REM and deep sleep suffer.
- **Caffeine has a long half-life.** For most people, none after 2pm. Some need to stop by noon.

### Exercise

- **Morning/early afternoon exercise** improves sleep.
- **Evening exercise** can work but finish 3+ hours before bed.
- **Intense exercise too late** raises core temperature and cortisol.

### Napping

- **Keep naps under 30 minutes** or go full 90 minutes (complete sleep cycle).
- **Before 3pm** to avoid disrupting nighttime sleep.
- **If you can't sleep at night**, eliminate naps entirely until nighttime sleep stabilizes.

## The wind-down matters

Your nervous system can't go from activated to asleep instantly.

### Create a shutdown ritual

60-90 minutes before bed:
1. Stop work completely
2. Dim lights
3. No screens (or blue-light filtered, low-brightness)
4. Relaxing activities: reading (paper), stretching, conversation, journaling
5. Same routine every night signals sleep is coming

### Clear the mental load

Racing thoughts at night usually mean unprocessed thoughts from the day.

- **Brain dump**: Write everything on your mind before bed
- **Tomorrow's plan**: Know what you're doing tomorrow so you're not planning when you should be sleeping
- **Worry time**: Schedule 15 minutes earlier in the day to worry deliberately, so it doesn't invade bedtime

## When you can't fall asleep

### Get out of bed

If you've been lying awake for 20+ minutes, get up. Go to another room. Do something boring in dim light. Return when sleepy.

This prevents your brain from associating bed with wakefulness.

### Don't try harder

Trying to sleep is counterproductive. Sleep comes when you let go, not when you grip harder.

Instead of trying to sleep:
- Focus on relaxation (not sleep as the goal)
- Notice body sensations
- Accept that rest is valuable even without sleep
- Trust that sleep will come eventually

### Challenge catastrophic thoughts

"I'll be useless tomorrow" → You've functioned on bad sleep before. You'll cope.

"I need 8 hours" → You'll get what you get. Worrying won't add hours.

The anxiety about not sleeping often causes more damage than the sleep loss itself.

## Supplements and tools

### What has evidence:

**Magnesium glycinate**: 200-400mg before bed. Many people are deficient. Helps relaxation and sleep quality.

**Glycine**: 3g before bed. May lower core temperature and improve sleep quality.

**Melatonin**: 0.3-0.5mg (low dose) 30-60 minutes before bed. Most people take too much. Lower doses often work better.

**Apigenin**: Found in chamomile. Mildly sedating.

**L-theanine**: 100-200mg. Promotes relaxation without sedation.

### What doesn't help long-term:

**Sleep medications**: Create dependency, don't improve actual sleep architecture, often make things worse over time.

**Alcohol**: Sedates but destroys sleep quality.

**Cannabis**: Can help falling asleep but reduces REM sleep.

### Tools:

**White noise/brown noise**: Masks disruptive sounds.

**Weighted blankets**: May help some people feel secure.

**Sleep trackers**: Useful for awareness, but don't obsess over the numbers. Worrying about sleep data can worsen sleep.

## When to get help

See a sleep specialist if:
- You consistently can't fall asleep or stay asleep despite good habits
- You snore heavily, gasp, or stop breathing (possible sleep apnea)
- You're excessively tired during the day despite adequate time in bed
- You have restless legs or periodic limb movements
- Sleep problems persist for more than a month

Many sleep disorders are treatable. Sleep apnea is extremely common and often undiagnosed.

## The deeper layer

Sleep problems often reflect life problems.

If you're not sleeping well, ask:
- Is anxiety running in the background?
- Am I living in a way that creates peace, or constant activation?
- Do I feel safe?
- Am I processing emotions during the day, or suppressing them until night?

Sometimes the sleep issue is technical. Sometimes it's existential.

Fix the mechanics. But also look at the life that surrounds the sleep.
