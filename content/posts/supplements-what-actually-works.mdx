The supplement industry is worth billions. Most of it is hype, wishful thinking, or outright scams.

But some supplements do work—for specific purposes, in specific people, at specific doses.

Here's what actually has evidence behind it.

## The foundation

### Food first

Supplements are supplements—they supplement, not replace, good nutrition.

No pill stack compensates for a poor diet. Get the basics in place:
- Adequate protein
- Vegetables and fruits
- Healthy fats
- Whole foods

Then consider supplements for gaps and specific purposes.

### Individual needs matter

What you need depends on:
- Your diet (vegetarians need B12)
- Where you live (northern latitudes need D)
- Your health status (certain conditions need certain nutrients)
- Your activity level (athletes have different needs)
- Your life stage (pregnancy, aging, etc.)

Universal recommendations are less useful than individual assessment.

### Testing when possible

For some nutrients, testing guides decisions:
- Vitamin D (blood test widely available)
- B12 (especially for vegetarians)
- Iron (don't supplement without testing—excess is harmful)
- Thyroid (affects need for selenium, iodine)

Guessing leads to wasted money or problems.

## What works (and for whom)

### Vitamin D

**Who needs it:** Most people in northern latitudes, those who don't get sun exposure, darker-skinned individuals, older adults.

**What it does:** Bone health, immune function, mood support, hormone regulation.

**Evidence:** Strong evidence for deficiency correction. Moderate evidence for mood and immune function.

**Dose:** 1000-4000 IU daily, depending on blood levels. Get tested and dose accordingly.

**Note:** Take with fat for absorption. Vitamin K2 helps direct calcium appropriately.

### Omega-3 fatty acids

**Who needs it:** Anyone not eating fatty fish 2-3x/week (most people).

**What it does:** Anti-inflammatory, brain support, cardiovascular health, mood support.

**Evidence:** Strong for inflammation reduction, moderate for depression, good for cardiovascular outcomes.

**Dose:** 1-3g combined EPA+DHA daily. Higher EPA:DHA ratio for mood, balanced for general health.

**Note:** Quality matters. Look for third-party testing. Burp-free versions exist.

### Magnesium

**Who needs it:** Many people—modern diets are often deficient.

**What it does:** Calms nervous system, supports sleep, muscle function, 300+ enzymatic reactions.

**Evidence:** Good for sleep, muscle cramps, anxiety, migraine prevention.

**Dose:** 200-400mg daily. Glycinate for calm/sleep, citrate for bowel regularity, threonate for cognitive focus.

**Note:** Loose stools mean too much—reduce dose.

### B12

**Who needs it:** Vegetarians and vegans (essential), older adults, those on certain medications.

**What it does:** Energy, nerve function, DNA synthesis, red blood cells.

**Evidence:** Strong—deficiency causes serious problems.

**Dose:** 250-1000mcg methylcobalamin or cyanocobalamin daily for vegetarians.

**Note:** Get tested if uncertain. Deficiency symptoms include fatigue, neuropathy, cognitive issues.

### Vitamin B complex

**Who needs it:** Those under chronic stress, vegetarians, those with mood issues.

**What it does:** Energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, stress response.

**Evidence:** Moderate for energy and mood support, especially when deficient.

**Dose:** Look for methylated forms (methylfolate, methylcobalamin) if you have MTHFR variants.

### Zinc

**Who needs it:** Vegetarians, those with immune issues or mood problems, older adults.

**What it does:** Immune function, neurotransmitter production, wound healing.

**Evidence:** Good for immune function, moderate for mood.

**Dose:** 15-30mg daily. Don't mega-dose long-term.

**Note:** Take with food to avoid nausea. Long-term use needs copper balance.

### Probiotics

**Who needs it:** After antibiotics, with digestive issues, possibly for mood.

**What it does:** Supports gut microbiome, may affect mood via gut-brain axis.

**Evidence:** Good for antibiotic recovery, moderate for IBS, emerging for mood.

**Dose:** Strain-specific. Look for CFU counts in billions. Specific strains for specific purposes.

**Note:** Not one-size-fits-all. Fermented foods may work as well for general support.

### Creatine

**Who needs it:** Athletes, older adults, vegetarians, possibly for cognitive support.

**What it does:** Muscle energy, power output, possibly brain energy.

**Evidence:** Strong for exercise performance, emerging for cognitive function.

**Dose:** 3-5g daily (monohydrate is best-studied).

**Note:** One of the most studied supplements. Very safe for most people.

### Iron

**Who needs it:** Only those with confirmed deficiency. Don't supplement without testing.

**What it does:** Oxygen transport, energy, dopamine production.

**Evidence:** Strong when deficient, harmful when not.

**Dose:** Based on deficiency level and type.

**Note:** Excess iron is dangerous. Always test first. Take with vitamin C for absorption.

## What doesn't work (or is overhyped)

### Multivitamins

Most research doesn't show benefit for general health in people eating reasonably well. Specific deficiencies need specific nutrients.

### Most "energy" supplements

Caffeine works. Most other energy supplements are either caffeine in disguise or unsupported.

### Most "brain" supplements

Nootropics are mostly hype. A few have evidence (omega-3s, creatine), most don't.

### Megadose vitamins

More isn't better. Megadosing is usually wasted (peed out) or harmful.

### Fat burners

Almost all are stimulants (caffeine) with marketing. They don't work meaningfully.

## How to approach supplements

### Start with testing

Where possible, test don't guess:
- Vitamin D
- B12
- Iron/ferritin
- Others based on symptoms

### Address deficiencies first

The biggest gains come from correcting actual deficiencies. Start there.

### Add for specific purposes

After basics, add supplements for specific purposes with good evidence.

### Quality matters

The supplement industry is poorly regulated. Look for:
- Third-party testing (NSF, USP, ConsumerLab)
- Reputable brands
- Appropriate forms (bioavailable)
- No unnecessary fillers

### Reassess periodically

Needs change. What you needed at one point may not be needed later. Reassess annually.

### Be skeptical

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to what has actual evidence.
