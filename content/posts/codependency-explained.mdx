Codependency is often misunderstood. It's not about being too nice or too loving. It's about losing your sense of self in your focus on others.

## What codependency actually is

Codependency is a pattern where your identity, self-worth, and emotional state become dependent on managing or fixing someone else.

Signs:
- You feel responsible for other people's feelings
- You have difficulty identifying your own needs
- You say yes when you mean no
- You feel anxious when others are upset
- Your mood depends on how others are doing
- You neglect yourself while focusing on others
- You attract or are attracted to people who need "fixing"

## Where it comes from

Codependency typically develops in childhood when:
- A parent was emotionally unavailable, addicted, or unwell
- You learned to manage a parent's emotions to feel safe
- Your needs were consistently deprioritized
- Love felt conditional on caretaking
- You became the "parentified child"

You learned that your value came from what you did for others, not who you were.

## The cost

Codependency creates:
- Chronic exhaustion (you're always managing others)
- Resentment (you give more than you receive)
- Lost identity (you don't know what you want)
- Dysfunctional relationships (you attract people who take)
- Anxiety (you can't control others, but you try)

## Breaking free

### 1. Recognize the pattern
Awareness is the first step. Notice when you're over-functioning for others.

### 2. Learn your own needs
Practice asking: "What do I want? What do I need?" This may feel foreign at first.

### 3. Build boundaries
Start saying no. Tolerate the discomfort. Other people's reactions aren't your responsibility.

### 4. Let others have their experience
You don't have to fix, rescue, or manage. Let people feel their feelings and solve their problems.

### 5. Develop a sense of self
Who are you apart from your relationships? What do you like? What matters to you?

## The paradox

Letting go of codependency doesn't mean caring less. It means caring from a solid sense of self rather than a desperate need to be needed.

Healthy interdependence is possible — connection without losing yourself.

That's the goal.
