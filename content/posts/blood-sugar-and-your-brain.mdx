You do the inner work. You manage your stress. You sleep well.

And still, at 3pm, you crash. Brain fog. Irritability. Anxiety that appeared from nowhere. Cravings you can't control.

Before you pathologize your mind, check your blood sugar.

## How blood sugar affects mental state

Your brain runs on glucose. It's about 2% of your body weight but uses 20% of your energy.

When blood sugar:

**Spikes too high:**
- Initial rush, maybe euphoria
- Followed by crash
- Brain fog, difficulty concentrating
- Anxiety as the body releases stress hormones to stabilize

**Drops too low:**
- Irritability, mood swings
- Difficulty thinking
- Anxiety, sometimes panic
- Fatigue
- Intense cravings (especially for sugar/carbs)

**Swings repeatedly:**
- Chronic inflammation
- Energy unpredictability
- Mood instability
- Over time: metabolic damage

The symptoms of blood sugar dysregulation look a lot like mental health issues. Sometimes they're mistaken for anxiety disorders, ADHD, or depression.

## The modern blood sugar disaster

We evolved eating foods that released glucose slowly. Roots. Leaves. Meat. Occasional fruit.

Now we eat foods that spike glucose dramatically. Refined flour, sugar, processed foods. We eat them constantly, often without protein or fat to slow absorption.

The result: roller coaster blood sugar, all day, every day.

Your great-grandmother didn't have breakfast cereal, mid-morning muffins, sandwiches on white bread, afternoon candy, and pasta dinners. Her blood sugar was stable. Ours isn't.

## Signs your blood sugar is unstable

- You get "hangry" (irritable when hungry)
- You crash between meals
- You need coffee to function
- You crave sweets, especially after meals
- You feel anxious for no apparent reason
- Brain fog that comes and goes
- Energy dips, especially afternoon
- You wake up at 3-4am and can't sleep
- You feel shaky if you don't eat

## How to stabilize blood sugar

### What you eat matters

**Prioritize:**
- Protein with every meal (slows glucose release)
- Healthy fats (same effect)
- Fiber (slows absorption)
- Vegetables (low glycemic, high nutrient)
- Whole, unprocessed foods

**Minimize:**
- Refined sugars
- White flour products
- Fruit juice, soda, sweet drinks
- Processed snacks
- Eating carbs alone

### How you eat matters

**Start meals with protein and vegetables.** Save starches for the end. This changes the glucose curve dramatically.

**Don't snack constantly.** Three solid meals often works better than six small ones. Every time you eat, you spike insulin.

**Don't skip meals.** Skipping, then binging, creates the roller coaster.

**Eat breakfast if you eat it.** Loading carbs first thing amplifies the roller coaster for the whole day.

### When you eat matters

**Post-meal walks.** Even 10 minutes after eating dramatically reduces glucose spike.

**Avoid late-night eating.** Your insulin sensitivity is worse at night.

**Consider time-restricted eating.** 12-16 hours without eating gives your system a break.

### What else helps

**Sleep.** One bad night of sleep reduces insulin sensitivity significantly.

**Exercise.** Makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Effects last 24-48 hours.

**Stress management.** Stress hormones raise blood sugar directly.

**Apple cider vinegar.** 1-2 tbsp before meals may help (research is promising).

**Cinnamon.** May improve insulin sensitivity.

## How to know what's happening

### Simple signs:
- How do you feel after meals?
- Do you crash at certain times?
- Are cravings controllable?

### Testing:
- **Fasting glucose**: Simple blood test
- **HbA1c**: Average blood sugar over 3 months
- **Fasting insulin**: Often overlooked but very informative
- **CGM (continuous glucose monitor)**: The most informative. Wear for 2 weeks and see exactly what foods do to you.

## The psychological dimension

Blood sugar instability and psychological distress often create a cycle:

- Blood sugar drops → anxiety increases
- Anxiety → reach for quick comfort food
- Quick food → blood sugar spikes then crashes
- Crash → more anxiety
- Repeat

Breaking the cycle requires working both ends — stabilizing blood sugar AND addressing the psychological patterns.

## The deeper point

Sometimes anxiety is about your life, your past, your relationships.

And sometimes it's about what you ate three hours ago.

One doesn't invalidate the other. Your psychology is embodied. Your body affects your mind. Your mind affects your body.

Check the basics before going deep. You might find the answer is closer than you think.
