Your brain lies to you. Not maliciously—it's trying to be efficient, to process information quickly, to keep you safe. But in the process, it develops shortcuts that systematically distort reality.

Cognitive distortions are these mental filters—patterns of thinking that twist what's actually happening into something else. Everyone has them. The question is whether you notice them.

## The Core Distortions

### All-or-Nothing Thinking

Black and white. Success or failure. Perfect or worthless. No middle ground.

"If I can't do it perfectly, there's no point trying."
"One mistake means the whole project is ruined."
"Either they love me completely or they don't care at all."

Reality is almost always gray. Partial successes exist. Relationships contain both connection and distance. Good enough is often good enough.

### Catastrophizing

Taking a small concern and spiraling it into disaster.

"I made a mistake at work → my boss will fire me → I'll never find another job → I'll lose my house → I'll end up on the street."

The mind races from minor setback to worst-case scenario, treating each step as inevitable.

### Mind Reading

Assuming you know what others think—usually something negative about you.

"They didn't respond to my text. They must be angry at me."
"He looked at me funny. He thinks I'm incompetent."
"She was quiet at dinner. She's probably planning to leave."

You don't actually know what others think. You're projecting your fears onto their silence.

### Fortune Telling

Predicting the future with certainty—and always negatively.

"The date will be awkward."
"I'll definitely fail the interview."
"This relationship will end badly like all the others."

You're treating anxious predictions as established fact.

### Emotional Reasoning

Believing something is true because it feels true.

"I feel like a failure, therefore I am a failure."
"I feel anxious, so something must be wrong."
"I feel unlovable, which proves no one could love me."

Feelings are real, but they're not reliable sources of information about reality.

### Should Statements

Rigid rules about how you, others, or life "should" be.

"I should be further along by now."
"They should know what I need."
"Life shouldn't be this hard."

"Shoulds" create suffering by arguing with reality.

### Personalization

Taking responsibility for things outside your control.

"They're in a bad mood because of something I did."
"If I had been there, the accident wouldn't have happened."
"The project failed because I wasn't good enough."

Not everything is about you. Not everything is your fault.

### Filtering

Filtering out the positive, focusing only on the negative.

You receive ten compliments and one criticism. You remember only the criticism. You have a good day with one bad moment, and the bad moment defines the day.

The negative becomes the whole picture.

### Discounting the Positive

When positive things do register, dismissing them.

"They only said that to be nice."
"That achievement doesn't count because it was easy."
"That compliment was just flattery."

You maintain a negative self-image by making positive evidence inadmissible.

### Overgeneralization

Extrapolating from single incidents to universal rules.

"I failed once, so I always fail."
"This relationship ended, so I'm incapable of love."
"They rejected me, so no one will ever accept me."

One data point becomes an eternal truth.

### Labeling

Assigning global labels based on specific behaviors.

"I made a mistake, therefore I'm an idiot."
"They cancelled plans, therefore they're unreliable."
"I lost my temper, therefore I'm a terrible person."

The behavior becomes an identity.

## Working with Distortions

Recognizing these patterns is the first step. Here's how to work with them:

### 1. Catch the Thought

Notice when you're upset and pause. What were you just thinking? Write it down exactly.

### 2. Identify the Distortion

Which pattern does this thought fit? Sometimes multiple. Name it: "This is all-or-nothing thinking." The naming creates distance.

### 3. Examine the Evidence

What's the actual evidence for and against this thought? Not feelings—evidence. What would hold up in court?

### 4. Find the Alternative

What's a more balanced, accurate way to see this? Not positive thinking—realistic thinking. What would a wise friend say?

### 5. Test It

When possible, test your predictions against reality. Did the catastrophe actually happen? Was your mind-reading accurate?

## Common Objections

**"But sometimes my negative thoughts are accurate."**

They might be. This isn't about positive thinking—it's about accurate thinking. Sometimes the realistic assessment is still concerning. But distinguish realistic concerns from distorted catastrophizing.

**"If I stop being self-critical, I'll become complacent."**

There's a difference between self-criticism and clear-eyed assessment. You can acknowledge problems without distorting them.

**"This feels fake."**

At first, challenging thoughts feels mechanical. With practice, it becomes more natural. You're building a new mental habit.

## The Deeper Work

Cognitive techniques are useful, but they're not the whole picture. Distortions often have roots in:

**Early experiences.** If you grew up with criticism, you developed a critical filter. If love was conditional, you learned to catastrophize about losing it.

**Core beliefs.** Deep convictions like "I'm not good enough" or "People always leave" shape which distortions you favor.

**Nervous system patterns.** Trauma and chronic stress rewire the brain toward threat detection. The distortions aren't just thoughts—they're physiological.

Addressing distortions at the cognitive level helps, but lasting change often requires working with the body and the biography too.

## A Kinder Relationship with Your Mind

Your mind developed these patterns for reasons. They were attempts to navigate a complex world with limited resources. Don't hate your brain for doing its best.

And don't expect perfection. Everyone distorts sometimes. The goal isn't pure rationality—it's catching the major distortions before they cause unnecessary suffering.

With practice, you'll notice the patterns more quickly. The distorted thought still arises, but now you see it for what it is. It loses some of its power.

And gradually, the gap between reaction and reflection widens. In that gap, a clearer view becomes possible.
