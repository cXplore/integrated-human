You're probably sitting right now.

You sat at breakfast. Sat in the car. Sat at your desk. Will sit at dinner. Will sit watching TV. Will sit tomorrow, and the next day.

The average adult sits 9-11 hours per day. Some sit more.

This isn't normal. Humans evolved to move. This much sitting is a modern experiment, and the results aren't good.

## What sitting does to your body

### Immediately

Within minutes of sitting:
- Electrical activity in leg muscles drops dramatically
- Calorie burning decreases to about 1 per minute
- Enzymes that break down fat drop by 90%
- Insulin effectiveness decreases

This is why standing desks and movement breaks help even if you exercise — exercise doesn't undo what's happening during 8+ hours of stillness.

### Over weeks and months

- Hip flexors shorten and tighten
- Glutes weaken and "turn off"
- Core muscles weaken
- Shoulders round forward
- Neck pushes forward (forward head posture)
- Thoracic spine stiffens

These adaptations happen because your body becomes efficient at what you do most. You do sitting most. Your body adapts to sitting.

### Over years

- Chronic back pain (often lower back)
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Hip pain
- Reduced cardiovascular function
- Increased blood pressure
- Higher blood sugar levels
- Increased risk of diabetes
- Increased risk of heart disease
- Increased risk of certain cancers
- Reduced life expectancy

The research is clear: prolonged sitting is an independent risk factor for disease, separate from exercise levels. Meaning: exercise helps, but doesn't fully offset sitting damage.

## The exercise paradox

You might think: "I exercise, so I'm fine."

But exercise and non-exercise activity are different categories.

Studies show:
- Someone who exercises 1 hour/day but sits 12 hours has worse health markers than someone who exercises 30 minutes but stands/walks throughout the day
- Light frequent movement throughout the day matters as much or more than dedicated exercise
- "Active couch potato" syndrome is real — fit in the gym, sedentary everywhere else

Exercise is necessary. But it's not sufficient to undo excessive sitting.

## The postural cascade

Sitting creates a predictable pattern of dysfunction:

**Hip flexors shorten** → You can't fully extend your hip → Your lower back compensates → Lower back pain

**Glutes "turn off"** → Hamstrings and lower back overwork → More lower back pain → Hamstrings feel tight

**Thoracic spine stiffens** → Shoulders roll forward → Shoulder pain → Neck strains to keep eyes forward → Neck pain and headaches

**Core weakens** → Spine loses support → Discs under more stress → Back problems accelerate

It's a connected system. Sitting affects all of it.

## Breaking the pattern

### Strategy 1: Interrupt sitting frequently

The dose matters. Sitting for 8 hours with breaks is different from sitting for 8 hours straight.

**Every 30 minutes:**
- Stand up
- Move for 1-2 minutes
- Walk to refill water
- Do a few squats or stretches

Setting a timer helps until it becomes habit.

### Strategy 2: Change positions

Sitting isn't inherently bad. Sitting in the same position for hours is bad.

**Options:**
- Standing desk (alternate sitting/standing)
- Sitting on the floor (forces position changes)
- Different chairs or setups
- Kneeling chair
- Perching (half sitting, half standing)

Variety is more important than finding the "perfect" position.

### Strategy 3: Move more overall

Look at your day as a whole:
- Can you walk or bike instead of drive?
- Can you take calls while walking?
- Can you have walking meetings?
- Can you stand on public transit?
- Can you take stairs instead of elevator?

The goal: increase total daily movement, not just scheduled exercise.

### Strategy 4: Reverse the adaptations

Your body adapted to sitting. Now help it adapt back.

**Hip flexor stretching/mobility:**
- Lunges with hip extension
- Couch stretch
- Hip flexor activation in extended position

**Glute activation:**
- Glute bridges
- Single-leg glute work
- Learning to use glutes when walking/standing

**Thoracic mobility:**
- Thoracic rotation drills
- Cat-cow
- Foam roller thoracic extension

**Core strengthening:**
- Dead bugs
- Planks (with proper form)
- Carries (walking with weight)

**Daily mobility routine:**
- Even 5-10 minutes of targeted work helps
- Counteract what sitting does

## The workspace setup

If you must sit, at least sit well:

**Monitor height:**
- Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- Direct in front of you, not to the side
- About arm's length away

**Chair:**
- Feet flat on floor (or footrest)
- Thighs parallel to floor
- Back supported
- Arms relaxed at sides, elbows roughly 90 degrees

**Keyboard and mouse:**
- Close to body
- Forearms parallel to floor
- Shoulders relaxed, not hunched

But remember: even perfect ergonomics don't eliminate the need to move.

## The deeper issue

This isn't just about back pain or cardiovascular risk. It's about what kind of animal you are.

You're a human being. Your ancestors walked miles daily, squatted to rest, climbed, carried, built, hunted, gathered. Your body is designed for constant varied movement.

You're now spending most of your life in a position that barely existed until recently.

No amount of optimization makes sitting natural. The body wants to move. The body needs to move.

The sitting epidemic is a mismatch between what we evolved to do and what modern life asks of us.

## Practical changes

**Small:**
- Stand up every 30 minutes
- Walk while on phone
- Take stairs
- Park farther away

**Medium:**
- Standing desk setup
- Daily mobility routine
- Walk or bike commute
- Walking meetings

**Large:**
- Redesign work to include movement
- Floor living at home (less furniture, more sitting/standing from floor)
- Activity-based hobbies
- Movement as default, not exception

## Start somewhere

You probably can't eliminate sitting. You can reduce it, interrupt it, and counteract it.

Pick one thing:
- A timer to stand every 30 minutes
- A standing desk trial
- A 5-minute mobility routine
- A walking meeting each day

Then add another. And another.

Your body will thank you. Your back will thank you. Your future self will thank you.

This isn't about perfection. It's about moving in the right direction.

Which, ironically, just means moving.
