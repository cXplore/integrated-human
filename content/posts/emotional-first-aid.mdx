You know physical first aid: when you're bleeding, apply pressure. When you're burned, run cold water. But what about emotional emergencies? When you're flooded with overwhelming emotion, what do you actually do?

This is emotional first aid—practical steps for acute distress.

## When You're Flooded

Emotional flooding is when feelings overwhelm your capacity to manage them:
- Heart racing
- Mind spinning
- Unable to think clearly
- Desperate urge to escape or act

First priority: stabilize.

### Stop and Recognize

"I'm flooded." "This is overwhelming." "My nervous system is activated."

Naming what's happening creates a sliver of distance.

### Ground Physically

Your body is always in the present. Use it:
- Feel feet on floor
- Press hands into something solid
- Hold something with texture
- Splash cold water on face

Physical grounding interrupts mental spiraling.

### Breathe Deliberately

Slow, extended exhales activate the calming system:
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Exhale for 8 counts
- Repeat 5-10 times

You can't panic and breathe slowly at the same time.

### Get Safe

If you're in a triggering environment, leave if possible. Go somewhere quiet. Step outside. Find a bathroom to collect yourself.

Physical space creates emotional space.

## For Anxiety

When anxiety spikes:

**Acknowledge it.** "I'm having anxiety. This is a physical experience. It will pass."

**Check reality.** What's actually happening right now? Not what might happen—what is?

**5-4-3-2-1.** 5 things you see. 4 things you hear. 3 things you touch. 2 things you smell. 1 thing you taste.

**Move your body.** Walk, shake, stretch. Discharge the activation.

**Don't avoid.** If the anxiety is about something specific and avoidable, not avoiding builds tolerance.

## For Anger

When anger surges:

**Pause before acting.** Count to 10. Leave the room. Don't send that text.

**Discharge physically.** Exercise, hit a pillow, yell in the car. The energy needs somewhere to go.

**Breathe.** Anger is high arousal. Calming breath brings down activation.

**Check underneath.** Often anger covers fear, hurt, or vulnerability. What's under the anger?

**Return when regulated.** If you need to address something, do it after the flood, not during.

## For Sadness and Grief

When grief overwhelms:

**Let yourself cry.** Tears are release. Don't suppress.

**Be gentle with yourself.** This is hard. You don't need to function perfectly.

**Reach out.** Don't isolate. Connection helps, even if you don't talk about what's wrong.

**Do small comforting things.** Warm drink. Soft blanket. Gentle music. Care for yourself as you would a hurt child.

**Remember impermanence.** This feeling won't last forever. It feels like it will—it won't.

## For Shame

When shame floods:

**Recognize shame.** Shame feels like you ARE bad, not that you did something bad. Notice the difference.

**Self-compassion.** "I'm human. Humans make mistakes. This doesn't define me."

**Challenge the narrative.** Is this really as catastrophic as shame makes it seem?

**Connection.** Shame wants you to hide. Counter by connecting (carefully) with someone safe.

**Separate behavior from self.** "I did something I regret" is different from "I am a terrible person."

## For Panic

When panic attacks:

**Know what it is.** This is a panic attack. It's terrifying but not dangerous. It will end.

**Breathe into the panic.** Fighting it makes it worse. As counterintuitive as it sounds, move toward the sensations.

**Ground aggressively.** Cold water on wrists and face. Ice cubes in hands. Strong sensory input.

**Don't flee.** If you can stay where you are safely, staying teaches your nervous system the threat isn't real.

**Ride the wave.** Panic peaks and passes. Usually 10-20 minutes. You can endure.

## When You're Numb

Sometimes overwhelming emotion leads to shutdown:

**Notice the numbness.** "I've gone numb. This is protective."

**Gentle activation.** Light movement. Gentle touch. Not forcing—inviting.

**Temperature.** Sometimes mild cold or warmth helps reconnect.

**Patience.** Numbness is protection. It will lift when you're ready.

## What Not to Do

- Don't make major decisions
- Don't send important messages
- Don't try to process deeply in the acute moment
- Don't isolate completely
- Don't use substances to escape

First aid is about stabilizing, not solving.

## After the Acute Phase

Once you've stabilized:

**Rest.** Flooding is exhausting. Allow recovery.

**Gentle processing.** Journal. Talk to someone. Let the experience settle.

**Learn.** What triggered this? What helped? What would help next time?

**Self-compassion.** You survived. You handled it. That counts.

## Building a First Aid Kit

Know in advance:
- What grounds you? (specific practices)
- Who can you call? (names and numbers)
- Where can you go? (safe places)
- What comforts you? (objects, activities)

Have this ready before you need it.

## When First Aid Isn't Enough

Some situations need more:
- Thoughts of self-harm
- Suicidal ideation
- Inability to function
- Prolonged acute distress
- Trauma responses

These need professional support, not just self-help. Reach out to a therapist, crisis line, or emergency services.

## The Practice

Emotional first aid is a skill. Like physical first aid, it improves with practice:
- Use the tools when distress is moderate, not just when flooded
- Review what works and what doesn't
- Keep refining your personal toolkit

You will get flooded again. That's human.

But you can get better at riding the wave.

That's emotional first aid.
