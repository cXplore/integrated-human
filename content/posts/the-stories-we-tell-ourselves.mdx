You live inside a story. Not a fairy tale—a narrative about who you are, why things happen to you, what the world is like, and what's possible.

This story runs constantly in the background, filtering perception, guiding decisions, shaping emotions. Most of it operates below conscious awareness.

Understanding your story—and recognizing you have the power to revise it—might be one of the most important things you do.

## We Are Storytelling Creatures

Humans don't experience raw reality. We experience interpreted reality, organized into narratives that create meaning.

This is how the brain works. Random events are connected into sequences. Causes are assigned to effects. Characters (including you) are given roles and motivations. A plot emerges.

This storytelling is automatic. You can't stop it. The question is whether you notice it.

## The Stories That Run

Common background narratives:

**The origin story.** Where you came from, what happened to you, how you became who you are. This story shapes what you believe is possible based on where you've been.

**The identity story.** Who you fundamentally are—your character, your nature, your essence. "I'm the kind of person who..." "I've always been..."

**The wound story.** What hurt you, how you were wronged, the injustice done to you. This story can justify present limitations and future avoidance.

**The limitation story.** What you can't do, what's too hard, what's not possible for "someone like you."

**The world story.** What the world is like. Safe or dangerous? Abundant or scarce? Full of good people or bad ones?

**The future story.** What's coming. Hope or doom? Expansion or contraction? More of the same or genuine change?

## How Stories Become Self-Fulfilling

Here's the mechanism:

1. You hold a story about yourself or the world
2. The story shapes what you notice (confirmation bias)
3. It influences what you do and don't attempt
4. Actions create results that seem to confirm the story
5. The story strengthens

If your story says "people always leave," you'll:
- Notice signs of leaving (even ambiguous ones)
- Behave in ways that push people away (testing, distancing)
- Interpret departures as proof
- Not notice or explain away people who stay

The story creates the reality it describes.

## Recognizing Your Stories

Stories are invisible when you're inside them. Here's how to step back:

**Listen to your explanations.** When you explain why something happened or why you can't do something, you're telling a story. Is it the only possible interpretation?

**Notice "always" and "never."** These words often signal story. "I always get rejected." "It never works out." Is that literally true, or is it a narrative?

**Watch for "just the way I am."** This phrase freezes identity into story. Are you describing a permanent fact or a changeable pattern?

**Examine your predictions.** When you predict the future, you're writing the next chapter of your story. Is that what will happen, or what you expect based on the narrative you've been telling?

**Ask others.** People outside your story see things you can't. What story do they see you living?

## Story vs. Reality

A crucial distinction:

**What happened** is fact. Events occurred.

**The story about what happened** is interpretation. It assigns meaning, causation, roles.

These are not the same thing. The story always goes beyond the facts, adding interpretation that may or may not be accurate.

"My father wasn't around" is fact.
"My father abandoned me" is story.
"I'm damaged goods because my father left" is story on top of story.

You can't change what happened. You can change the story you tell about it.

## Revising the Narrative

Changing your story isn't denying reality or positive thinking. It's recognizing that the story you tell is a choice—often made unconsciously, but a choice nonetheless.

### 1. Identify the Current Story

Write it out. What's the story you're living? Be specific. What's the plot? Who are the characters? What role do you play?

### 2. Question the Story

Is this story absolutely true? What evidence contradicts it? What alternative interpretations exist? Whose voice originally told you this story?

### 3. Consider the Function

What does this story do for you? Stories persist because they serve some purpose, even harmful ones. Does yours justify? Protect? Explain? Excuse?

### 4. Find a More True Story

Not a positive story—a more accurate one. One that includes more data. One that assigns less fixed meaning to past events. One that opens more possibility.

### 5. Practice the New Story

Telling yourself a new story once doesn't rewire decades of the old one. Repetition matters. Notice when the old story plays. Consciously practice the new version.

## Common Revisions

**From wound to growth:** "This damaged me" → "This shaped me, and I can continue shaping myself"

**From fixed to fluid:** "I am this way" → "I have been this way; I can develop"

**From victim to agent:** "This happened to me" → "This happened, and I have choices about what happens next"

**From singular to multiple:** "The one truth about me" → "One of many things true about me"

**From closed to open:** "It will be like this" → "It might be different than I expect"

## The Meta-Story

Here's the deepest level: you can also have a story about whether stories can change.

"I'm stuck with my story" is itself a story.
"Stories are just interpretations that can be revised" is a more empowering one.

Noticing that you are the author—not just the character—of your narrative changes everything.

## Stories and Truth

This isn't about inventing convenient fictions. Self-deception has costs.

The goal is stories that are:
- More complete (including positive evidence, not just negative)
- More accurate (distinguishing fact from interpretation)
- More useful (enabling rather than limiting)
- More fluid (allowing revision as you grow)

The most true story is one that acknowledges complexity, holds multiple perspectives, and remains open to new chapters.

## Writing Forward

You can't change the past chapters of your story. But you're currently writing the present and future chapters.

What story do you want to live going forward?

Not a fantasy—a genuine narrative that accounts for what's happened while opening possibility for what hasn't happened yet.

You are both the author and the protagonist. The past was written. The future pages are blank.

What will you write?
