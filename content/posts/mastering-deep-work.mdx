Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. It's increasingly rare—and increasingly valuable.

In a world of constant interruption, the ability to go deep is a superpower.

## What Deep Work Produces

Deep work isn't just about getting more done. It produces qualitatively different output:

- **Better quality:** Errors come from fragmented attention
- **Faster mastery:** Deliberate practice requires depth
- **More creativity:** Insights require sustained focus
- **Greater satisfaction:** Flow states happen during deep work

The most meaningful work requires depth. Shallow work—emails, meetings, administrative tasks—keeps things running but rarely creates breakthrough value.

## The Attention Residue Problem

Every time you check email, glance at notifications, or switch tasks, part of your attention stays behind. This "attention residue" degrades subsequent focus.

Studies show it takes 15-25 minutes to fully return to a task after an interruption. In a fragmented workday, you may never achieve deep focus at all.

## Designing for Depth

**Schedule deep work:**
- Block specific times for deep work in your calendar
- Treat these blocks as non-negotiable
- Early morning often works best (fewer interruptions, peak willpower)

**Create barriers:**
- Phone in another room (not just silenced)
- Close all unnecessary browser tabs
- Use website blockers during focus time
- Communicate your availability to others

**Establish rituals:**
- Same time, same place when possible
- A startup ritual (specific coffee, specific music, specific sequence)
- A shutdown ritual to mark the end

## The Four Deep Work Philosophies

**Monastic:** Eliminate shallow obligations almost entirely. For those whose primary value comes from deep work (writers, researchers).

**Bimodal:** Alternate between clearly defined periods of deep work and normal life. Minimum one full day for the deep period.

**Rhythmic:** Daily scheduled time for deep work. The chain method—don't break the streak.

**Journalistic:** Fit deep work wherever possible. Requires ability to switch modes rapidly. Hardest to maintain.

Most people do best with rhythmic or bimodal approaches.

## Building Deep Work Capacity

Your capacity for deep work can be trained:

**Start small:** If you can currently focus for 30 minutes, that's your baseline. Build from there.

**Add duration gradually:** Increase by 15-minute increments. 4 hours is likely the daily maximum for most people.

**Practice concentration:** Meditation, reading without breaks, single-tasking all build the focus muscle.

**Protect recovery:** Deep work requires recovery. Don't try to go deep all day every day.

## The Role of Boredom

If you can't tolerate boredom, you can't do deep work. Every moment of line-waiting filled with phone scrolling erodes your capacity for depth.

**Productive boredom:** Let yourself be bored regularly. Wait without checking your phone. Let your mind wander.

This trains your brain that stimulation isn't always available—which makes sustained focus possible.

## Deep Work Sessions

A typical deep work session:

**Warm-up (5-10 minutes):**
- Review what you're working on
- Set a clear goal for the session
- Let your mind settle

**Deep work (60-90 minutes):**
- Single task, full focus
- When mind wanders, notice and return
- Push through initial resistance

**Break (10-20 minutes):**
- Actual break—not email
- Move your body
- Let your mind diffuse

**Optional second block:** Repeat if appropriate.

## Metrics and Tracking

Track your deep work:
- Hours of deep work per day/week
- What interrupts you most frequently
- Which conditions produce best results

What gets measured improves. Even just noticing how much (or how little) deep work you're doing changes behavior.

## Deep Work Enemies

**Internal:**
- The urge to check things (trained by intermittent rewards)
- Resistance to hard thinking (brain conserving energy)
- Lack of clarity on what to work on

**External:**
- Open offices
- Chat/messaging expectations
- Meeting culture
- Phones and notifications

You can control internal enemies directly. External enemies require boundary-setting and sometimes difficult conversations.

## Integration with Life

Deep work isn't the only thing that matters. Relationships, rest, play, and even shallow work have their place.

The goal is to protect space for depth—not to eliminate everything else. A life of nothing but deep work would be unbalanced.

But most modern lives have too little depth, not too much. Even 2-4 hours of daily deep work puts you far ahead of average.

## Getting Started

**This week:**
1. Block 90 minutes for deep work tomorrow morning
2. Eliminate all distractions during that block
3. Work on one cognitively demanding task
4. Notice what happens

Then build from there. Your capacity for depth is like a muscle—it grows with use, atrophies without it.

The ability to go deep is trainable. Start training.
