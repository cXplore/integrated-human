Protein gets associated primarily with muscle and bodybuilding. This undersells its importance. Protein is essential for virtually every function in your body—and most people don't get enough.

## What Protein Does

Protein isn't just about biceps. It provides:

**Structural components.** Muscle, yes, but also bones, skin, hair, organs, connective tissue. Your body is literally built from protein.

**Enzymes.** The molecules that enable every biochemical reaction in your body are proteins.

**Hormones.** Many hormones (insulin, growth hormone, thyroid hormones) are proteins.

**Immune function.** Antibodies are proteins. Immune cells depend on protein.

**Transport.** Hemoglobin (carries oxygen), lipoproteins (carry fats), and many other transport molecules are proteins.

**Signaling.** Cell communication often involves protein molecules.

Without adequate protein, all these functions suffer.

## Why People Don't Get Enough

**Underestimating needs.** The RDA is a minimum to prevent deficiency, not optimal intake.

**Plant-based concerns.** Fear about meat, but not replacing adequately.

**Convenience foods.** Carbs and fats are cheaper and easier.

**Satiety.** Protein is filling, which sounds good but can mean eating less of it.

**Cost.** Quality protein sources tend to be more expensive.

## How Much Do You Need?

The RDA (0.8g per kg body weight) is low for most purposes. Current evidence suggests:

**Sedentary adults.** 1.0-1.2g per kg minimum

**Active individuals.** 1.4-2.0g per kg

**Athletes, muscle building, or fat loss.** 1.6-2.2g per kg

**Older adults.** 1.0-1.5g per kg (protein needs increase with age due to decreased efficiency)

For a 70kg (154lb) person, this means 100-150g of protein daily, depending on goals and activity—far more than many people consume.

## Protein Quality Matters

Not all protein is equal:

**Complete proteins.** Contain all essential amino acids in adequate amounts. Animal sources, soy, quinoa.

**Incomplete proteins.** Missing or low in some essential amino acids. Most plant sources.

**Bioavailability.** How well your body absorbs and uses the protein. Animal proteins are generally more bioavailable than plant proteins.

You can get adequate protein from plant sources, but it requires more attention to variety and quantity.

## Distribution Matters

Your body can only use so much protein at once for muscle synthesis (probably 30-50g per meal for most people). Eating all your protein in one meal is less effective than distributing it across the day.

Aim for substantial protein at each meal rather than relying on one protein-heavy meal.

## Protein and Aging

Muscle loss accelerates with age (sarcopenia). This matters because:
- Muscle is metabolically active (affects metabolic rate)
- Muscle is protective (prevents falls, maintains independence)
- Muscle affects blood sugar regulation

Older adults need more protein per kg than younger adults—and often eat less. This is a setup for decline.

Maintaining muscle through adequate protein and resistance training is one of the most important things for healthy aging.

## Protein and Satiety

Protein is the most satiating macronutrient. It:
- Reduces hunger between meals
- Decreases subsequent food intake
- Helps maintain calorie control without feeling deprived

For anyone managing weight, protein is an ally, not an enemy.

## Protein and Fat Loss

During fat loss (caloric deficit), protein is especially important:
- Preserves muscle mass that would otherwise be lost
- Maintains metabolic rate
- Manages hunger
- Supports exercise recovery

Eating higher protein during a diet is one of the few well-supported diet modifications.

## Sources

**Animal sources.** Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy. Complete proteins, high bioavailability.

**Plant sources.** Legumes, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds, grains. Often incomplete, varying bioavailability.

**Supplements.** Whey, casein, pea, rice protein powders. Convenient, but whole foods are generally preferable.

A mixed diet that includes both animal and plant proteins covers all bases. If you're plant-based, be more intentional about variety and quantity.

## Common Concerns

**"Will too much protein damage my kidneys?"** In healthy kidneys, no. This concern is based on studies of people with existing kidney disease. Healthy kidneys handle high protein fine.

**"Isn't high protein bad for bones?"** Old myth. Protein actually supports bone health when calcium is adequate.

**"Isn't meat causing all kinds of diseases?"** The research is complex and often conflated with processed meat, poor overall diet, and confounding factors. Quality protein from whole food sources in context of a good diet is not a problem.

## Practical Application

**Audit current intake.** Track for a few days. Most people are surprised how little protein they get.

**Add protein to each meal.** Eggs at breakfast. Meat, fish, or legumes at lunch and dinner.

**Consider protein first.** When planning meals, start with protein source.

**Supplement if needed.** Protein powder isn't magic, but it's convenient for hitting targets.

**Quality matters.** Choose whole food sources over highly processed protein products.

## Starting Point

If you're currently getting 60g of protein daily and should be getting 120g, you won't fix that overnight. Start with one meal—make it more protein-centric.

Then the next meal. Then add protein snacks.

Build the habit gradually.

Your body is made of protein. Give it enough raw material to maintain and rebuild itself.

This is foundational. Get it right, and many other things get easier.
