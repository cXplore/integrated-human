Eating doesn't have to be complicated. This is about simple, low-pressure ways to nourish yourself—especially on days when food feels like too much to think about.

No nutrition lectures. Just practical options that work.

## If You Can't Eat

When food feels impossible, your body is often in a stress state that suppresses appetite. Or the act of eating has become tangled with anxiety, control, or overwhelm.

**The simplest possible nourishment:**
- A few sips of something with calories (juice, milk, smoothie)
- A single bite of something—anything
- Something that requires no preparation
- Whatever sounds even slightly tolerable

You don't need to eat a meal. You need to give your body something.

## Foods That Require Nothing From You

When you have no energy for food decisions or preparation:

- Crackers or bread (eaten plain is fine)
- Cheese that's already sliced
- Fruit you can eat without cutting
- Yogurt with a spoon
- Nuts or trail mix
- A protein bar
- Peanut butter on anything (or off a spoon)
- Cereal, dry or with milk
- Anything delivery or takeout

The "healthiest" food is the one you can actually eat right now.

## If Eating Triggers Anxiety

When food itself feels threatening:

**Start impossibly small:**
- One bite, then stop
- Permission to not finish anything
- Eating alone if that's easier
- Eating in a comfortable place
- No rules about what or when

**Remove the performance:**
- You don't have to eat at a table
- You don't have to use proper dishes
- You don't have to eat "normally"
- You just have to get something in your body

## If You Can't Stop Eating

When eating feels out of control:

This isn't about willpower. Compulsive eating is usually a nervous system response—your body seeking regulation through food, or trying to fill something that isn't physical hunger.

**In the moment:**
- You're not bad for eating
- Stopping mid-binge is always an option (even one bite less counts)
- Drinking water between bites can slow things down
- Moving to a different room can break the trance

**What might actually help:**
- Ask what you're actually hungry for (comfort? distraction? numbing?)
- The binge will end. You will be okay.
- Shame makes it worse, not better

## When You Don't Know What You Want

Decision fatigue around food is real. When you can't choose:

- Eat whatever is closest
- Eat whatever requires the least effort
- Eat what you ate yesterday
- Let someone else decide
- Default to something bland and safe

The goal isn't optimal nutrition. It's getting some calories into your body so your brain can function.

## For the Next Few Hours

If eating feels impossible right now, try this sequence:

1. **Drink something** (water, tea, juice—anything)
2. **Wait 15 minutes**
3. **Try one bite of something** (if possible)
4. **No pressure to continue**

Repeat when you can.

## What Your Body Needs to Know

You are allowed to:
- Eat the same thing every day
- Eat at weird times
- Eat "kids' food" or "comfort food"
- Not enjoy eating right now
- Eat in bed
- Not finish things
- Have someone else handle food for a while

## When This Is Ongoing

If your relationship with food has been difficult for a while, this isn't something to white-knuckle through alone.

Eating disorders, disordered eating, and chronic food struggles respond to treatment. Not willpower—actual support from people who understand.

When you have slightly more capacity, consider:
- Talking to a doctor
- Finding a therapist who specializes in eating
- An eating disorder helpline
- Telling one trusted person what's happening

## Right Now

If you've read this far, you're trying to take care of yourself. That impulse matters.

Eat something small if you can. Drink something if you can't eat. Rest if you can't do either.

Your body is trying to survive. Help it in whatever small way is possible today.

Tomorrow you can think about more. Today, something is enough.
