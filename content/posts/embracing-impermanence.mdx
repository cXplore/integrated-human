Everything you love will change or end. Your body will age. People you care about will leave or die. Experiences you cherish will pass. This isn't pessimism—it's the fundamental nature of existence.

Buddhism calls it impermanence (anicca). Other traditions have different names. The insight is universal.

And strangely, embracing this truth leads not to despair but to liberation.

## The Reality

Everything that arises, passes. Everything that's born, dies. Everything that comes together, falls apart.

This includes:
- Your body
- All relationships
- Every experience
- All possessions
- Every achievement
- Every problem
- This moment
- Your very identity

Nothing holds still. The river of change flows continuously.

## Why We Resist

We resist impermanence because:

**It threatens identity.** If everything changes, what am I?

**It means loss.** What I love will go.

**It seems unfair.** Why can't the good things last?

**It triggers anxiety.** The ground is unstable.

So we pretend. We plan for permanence. We build structures against change. We cling to what we have as if clinging could preserve it.

This resistance is the root of much suffering.

## The Cost of Resistance

Fighting impermanence creates:

**Anxiety.** Constant background fear that the good will end.

**Grasping.** Desperate clinging that strangles what we try to hold.

**Avoidance of depth.** Not fully engaging because engagement means eventual loss.

**Rigid identity.** Defending a fixed self-image against the tide of change.

**Complicated grief.** Surprise and outrage when things end that were always going to end.

We spend enormous energy fighting a battle that can't be won.

## The Liberation of Acceptance

Something strange happens when you stop fighting impermanence:

**Presence intensifies.** Knowing this moment will pass, you meet it fully.

**Gratitude deepens.** Everything becomes precious because nothing is guaranteed.

**Grasping relaxes.** Without the need to preserve, you can simply enjoy.

**Fear diminishes.** When you accept change, you fear it less.

**Flow increases.** Life moves more freely when you're not constantly braking.

The same truth that seems terrifying becomes the doorway to freedom.

## Impermanence and Appreciation

Consider a sunset. Part of its beauty is its transience. A sunset that lasted forever wouldn't be beautiful—it would be wallpaper.

The same is true of everything:
- The sweetness of a child's age—because they'll grow
- The preciousness of health—because it's not guaranteed
- The depth of this conversation—because it will end
- The value of this life—because it's finite

Impermanence is what makes things precious. A diamond that lasted forever in infinite supply wouldn't be a diamond.

## Practice: Contemplating Change

Sit quietly. Look at something you care about—a person, an object, your own hand.

Consider: this too will change. This relationship will shift or end. This body will age and die. This object will break or decay.

Let the truth land. Not morbidly—simply honestly.

Notice what arises. Sadness perhaps. But also, often, a tenderness. A desire to appreciate what's here while it's here.

This practice, repeated, changes your relationship to impermanence.

## Impermanence and Identity

If everything changes, what am I?

The self you think of as "you" is also impermanent:
- Your body replaces its cells regularly
- Your personality has shifted over decades
- Your beliefs have changed
- Your relationships have transformed you

The "you" of ten years ago is substantially different from the "you" now.

Yet something continues. What is it?

This is a deep question that contemplative traditions have explored for millennia. But one insight: you are less a thing and more a process. Not a noun but a verb. Constantly becoming, never fixed.

This can feel groundless. But it's also freedom from the prison of a fixed identity.

## The Problem and the Solution Are the Same

What if the thing you fear about impermanence—that nothing lasts—is also the thing that saves you?

Because problems don't last either. Pain changes. Suffering ends. Dark periods give way.

The same impermanence that takes the good also takes the bad. It's not biased.

This is comfort in dark times: this too shall pass. It's also motivation in good times: appreciate this now, before it passes.

## Death: The Ultimate Impermanence

Impermanence culminates in death. Everything else is preparation.

Cultures that deny death also struggle with impermanence generally. Cultures that integrate death tend to be more present-oriented.

Contemplating death—not morbidly but honestly—is one of the most effective practices for embracing impermanence. When you know you'll die, what matters becomes clearer.

## The Middle Way

Embracing impermanence doesn't mean:
- Not caring because nothing lasts
- Not planning because everything changes
- Not loving because loss is inevitable

It means:
- Caring while accepting that caring leads to grief
- Planning while holding plans lightly
- Loving fully, knowing love includes loss

The middle way is full engagement with life, held in awareness of its transient nature.

## Beginning

Today, notice something changing. A relationship shifting. Your body aging. A season turning. An era ending.

Don't resist the noticing. Let it be. Let the impermanence be visible.

Then ask: what wants to be appreciated right now, while it's still here?

Turn toward that. Give it your attention.

This is the practice. Repeated daily, it transforms your relationship to change.

Everything will pass. Everything is passing.

The question is whether you'll meet it while it's here.
