You probably have more grief than you realize.

Not just from deaths. From the relationship that ended. The childhood you didn't get. The version of yourself you had to abandon. The future that isn't going to happen. The person you loved who became someone else.

Grief is the natural response to loss. And loss is everywhere. But our culture is exceptionally bad at letting it move through us.

So we carry it. It goes underground. It shows up as anxiety, numbness, chronic tension, sudden tears that make no sense, or a flatness that nothing seems to touch.

## The Losses We Don't Acknowledge

When someone dies, we have rituals. Not great ones, but something. A funeral. Condolences. Time off work. Permission to not be okay.

But what about:

**The end of a relationship.** Even if it was right to leave, you're still losing the future you imagined. The daily presence. The person who knew you that way.

**The family you didn't have.** If your childhood was neglectful, abusive, or just insufficient, you're grieving parents who weren't there, a safety you never felt, a foundation you had to build yourself.

**The version of yourself that had to die.** The carefree child. The person before the trauma. The idealist before the world taught its lessons. The one who could still trust easily.

**Dreams that aren't happening.** The career that didn't work out. The marriage that ended. The children you won't have. The life you thought you'd be living by now.

**The world you thought existed.** Faith in institutions, in goodness, in a narrative that made sense. When this breaks, there's grief—even if it doesn't look like it.

These are real losses. But we don't treat them that way. We expect ourselves to "get over it," to move on, to be positive. So the grief stays stuck.

## How Buried Grief Shows Up

Unexpressed grief doesn't stay quiet. It just speaks in a different language:

**Chronic low-grade depression.** Not acute despair, but a flatness. Nothing quite lands. Colors seem muted. The world feels distant.

**Anxiety that won't resolve.** The nervous system knows something is unprocessed. It stays activated, waiting for the release that never comes.

**Numbness.** The psyche's circuit breaker. Too much pain, so everything gets turned down. You can't feel the grief—but you can't feel much else either.

**Rage.** Grief and anger are intimately connected. Sometimes the anger is about the loss itself. Sometimes it's covering the vulnerable layers beneath.

**Nostalgia addiction.** Constantly returning to the past, unable to be in the present. Living in what was rather than what is.

**Sudden waves.** A song, a smell, a random memory—and suddenly you're crying or overwhelmed. The grief is still there, surfacing when it can.

**Physical tension.** The body holds what the mind won't process. Chronic tightness, particularly in the chest, throat, and belly.

## Why We Don't Grieve

Several forces conspire against healthy grieving:

**Cultural norms.** "Be strong." "Stay positive." "Don't dwell." We're expected to bounce back quickly. Extended grief is treated as weakness or pathology.

**The vulnerability of it.** Grief requires opening to helplessness. There's nothing to fix, solve, or do. You just have to feel. This is intolerable for those who find value in control.

**The fear of drowning.** If I really let myself feel this, I'll never stop crying. I'll fall apart. I won't be able to function. (This is almost never what happens—the opposite is usually true.)

**Not knowing how.** No one taught us. We don't have models for healthy grief. So we do what we saw our parents do: suppress, distract, minimize.

**The losses aren't validated.** If no one acknowledges that you've lost something, it's hard to grieve. Non-death losses are particularly prone to this.

## How to Grieve

Grief isn't a technique. It's a letting-go. But there are things that help:

### Make Space for It

Grief needs time and solitude. Not forever, but regularly. A ritual time when you let yourself feel what's there.

This might be:
- Journaling about the loss
- Looking at photos and memories
- Playing music that opens you up
- Simply sitting with the feelings that arise

What it's not: fixing, solving, reframing, looking for the bright side.

### Let the Body Move It

Grief is stored in the body. It often needs physical expression to release:

- Crying (obvious, but often suppressed)
- Shaking, trembling
- Making sounds—keening, wailing, moaning
- Movement that isn't goal-directed

This might feel strange. It works anyway. The body knows how to process if you let it.

### Speak It

Giving grief language helps. This might be:
- Talking to a therapist or trusted friend
- Writing letters to what you've lost
- Speaking out loud to the person who died
- Simply naming: "I am grieving ___"

Grief shared is lighter than grief carried alone.

### Accept the Waves

Grief doesn't proceed in neat stages. It comes in waves—sometimes expected, sometimes out of nowhere. You might feel fine for weeks, then get leveled by a memory.

This is normal. Healing isn't linear. The waves get further apart over time, but they may never fully stop—and that's okay.

### Don't Rush

There's no timeline for grief. It takes as long as it takes. Pushing yourself to "move on" before you're ready just delays the process.

At the same time, grief shouldn't become an identity. If you're still in acute grief years later with no movement, something is stuck and might need professional support.

## The Gifts of Grief

This isn't about finding a silver lining. Some losses are simply terrible, and trying to make them "worth it" is its own violence.

But when grief is fully processed, something does shift:

**Presence.** You're more here because you've stopped running from the pain.

**Compassion.** Having touched your own suffering, you recognize it in others.

**Depth.** The unlived life is shallow. Grief carves channels for deeper experience.

**Clarity.** You know what matters. You stop wasting time on what doesn't.

**Aliveness.** Paradoxically, fully feeling loss makes you more alive. You're no longer numbing the world.

## What You're Really Grieving

Sometimes the surface loss is pointing to something deeper.

The breakup might be about the hope of being loved that you're losing.

The career failure might be about the identity that's dying.

The parent who wasn't there might be about the safety you never had.

If grief feels bigger than the loss warrants, there's probably more underneath. Earlier losses that never got processed. Core wounds that the current loss is touching.

This is where therapy can help—tracking the grief to its roots.

## Starting Now

What are you carrying that you haven't let yourself grieve?

Make a list. Include the obvious losses and the hidden ones. The deaths and the endings. The futures that won't happen and the pasts you had to survive.

Then pick one. Give it time. Let yourself feel it—not fix it, understand it, or reframe it. Just feel.

This is the opposite of what we're taught to do. It's also the way through.

The grief you don't process doesn't disappear. It just waits. Taking up space. Coloring everything.

Let it move. Let it go. It's been waiting.
