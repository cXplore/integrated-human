You lost something.

Maybe someone died. Maybe a relationship ended. Maybe a dream died, or an identity, or a version of yourself. Maybe you lost what could have been—a future that will now never exist.

And now you're supposed to grieve.

But no one told you what that actually means. They gave you stages (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance), which sound neat but match nothing you're actually experiencing. They told you time heals all wounds, but your wound seems to be getting worse.

So let's start again. What is grief, actually?

## Grief is not stages

Elisabeth Kübler-Ross's stages were never meant to describe grief. They were observations about how people face their own death—not how survivors process loss.

The stages got applied to grief anyway, and now they're everywhere. The problem: they don't match reality.

Grief doesn't proceed in order. You don't complete anger and graduate to bargaining. You don't reach acceptance and stay there.

**What grief actually looks like:**
- Circular, not linear
- Waves, not stages
- Revisiting the same emotions repeatedly
- Good days followed by devastating days
- Feeling "fine" and then suddenly not
- Making progress and then falling apart
- Multiple emotions at once, not one at a time

If you're grieving and your experience doesn't match the stages, that's because the stages are wrong, not you.

## Grief is love with nowhere to go

This is the simplest, truest definition I know.

You loved something. Now it's gone. And all that love—which used to flow toward the person, the future, the dream—has nowhere to land.

So it moves through you in wild patterns. It becomes pain, longing, anger, despair. It becomes the search for what's lost, the calling out to what won't answer.

Grief isn't a problem to solve. It's love that lost its object.

This reframe matters. When you see grief as love, you stop trying to get rid of it. You start asking: how do I honor this love while learning to live without its object?

## The shapes grief takes

Grief isn't one thing. It shows up as:

### Sadness
The obvious one. The weight. The tears. The ache in your chest that won't go away.

### Anger
At the person who left. At God or fate. At yourself. At the doctor, the driver, the universe. Anger is grief's bodyguard—it protects you from the unbearable.

### Guilt
Should haves. Could haves. The last conversation you didn't know was the last. The things you said. The things you didn't say.

### Fear
Life without them. Your own mortality. The realization that everyone you love will die. That you will die.

### Numbness
When it's too much, you feel nothing. Dissociation. Going through motions. The strange calm that makes you wonder if you're broken.

### Relief
When death ends suffering. When a bad relationship ends. And then guilt about feeling relief.

### Despair
The bottom. The "what's the point." The inability to imagine a future worth living.

### Yearning
The physical ache to see them, touch them, hear them. The turning to tell them something and they're not there. The reaching for what's gone.

All of this is grief. Often multiple at once. Often none of it making sense.

## Grief isn't something you get over

The language is wrong.

"Getting over" implies:
- There's a destination of not-grieving
- Grief is an obstacle between you and that destination
- Success means leaving grief behind

But grief doesn't work this way.

**Better language:**
- You learn to carry it
- You integrate the loss into your life
- The grief becomes part of you, not something outside you
- You expand to hold both the loss and your life

You don't "get over" your father's death. You become someone who has experienced that loss—someone for whom that loss is woven into who you are.

The pain changes. It softens, usually. It becomes less acute, more bittersweet. But it doesn't disappear. It becomes yours.

## Grief is individual

Your grief doesn't have to look like anyone else's.

Some people wail. Some people go silent.
Some people need to talk about it constantly. Some can't mention it at all.
Some people grieve for years. Some seem to move forward quickly.
Some people grieve privately. Some need witnesses.

There's no correct way.

What looks like "not grieving" might be:
- Grieving in private
- Grieving differently than expected
- Being in numbness (which is grief)
- Taking longer to hit the reality

Don't compare your grief to others'. Don't judge others' grief. This is one of the most personal experiences a human can have.

## Complicated grief

Sometimes grief gets stuck.

**Normal grief:** Painful but moves. Gradually less acute over time. You function, even if barely.

**Complicated grief (prolonged grief disorder):**
- Intense grief that doesn't soften after 6-12 months
- Inability to function in basic ways
- Avoidance so complete you can't accept the death
- Preoccupation so complete you can't think about anything else
- Feeling stuck, frozen, unable to move forward at all

Complicated grief isn't failure. It's often about:
- The nature of the death (sudden, violent, suicide)
- The nature of the relationship (complicated, unresolved)
- Previous losses that got stacked
- Lack of support
- Circumstances that prevent processing

Complicated grief responds to specific therapeutic approaches. If you're stuck, this isn't character failure—it's something to address with professional support.

## What grief needs

Grief is a process. It needs:

### Time
Not because time heals all wounds, but because processing takes time. Rushing grief doesn't work.

### Space
Permission to grieve. Time away from demands. Room to fall apart.

### Expression
Grief that isn't expressed gets stuck. Talk, write, create, move, cry—find ways to let it out.

### Witness
Being seen in grief matters. Having someone who can be with you in it. Not fixing, not solving—just present.

### Ritual
Humans need rituals for death. Funerals, memorials, anniversaries, private practices—ways to mark and honor the loss.

### Meaning
Not "what's the lesson" or toxic positivity. But eventually, some way to integrate the loss into a life that still has purpose.

### Continued bonds
The relationship doesn't end at death. Many people maintain ongoing connection with the dead—through memory, through ritual, through internal relationship. This is healthy.

## What grief doesn't need

### Fixing
"At least they're not suffering." "They're in a better place." "Everything happens for a reason."

Stop. This helps no one. It's about the speaker's discomfort, not the griever's healing.

### Timelines
"It's been six months, you should be..." No. There's no should. Grief takes as long as it takes.

### Comparison
"My loss was worse." "At least you had them for X years." Pain is not a competition.

### Advice
"You should try..." "What helped me was..." Unless asked, don't.

### Cheering up
"Let's go out, it'll make you feel better." Sometimes. But don't force premature positivity.

What grievers need is presence. Someone who can sit in the dark with them without trying to turn on the lights.

## Living with grief

Eventually, grief asks you to do something impossible:

Live fully while carrying loss.

This isn't moving on. It's moving with.

**What this looks like:**
- Carrying your loss with you, not leaving it behind
- Finding joy again while still knowing sorrow
- Loving new people without replacing who's gone
- Building a new life that includes the loss, not despite it
- Being forever changed, not returning to who you were

You don't heal by forgetting. You heal by expanding—becoming someone who can hold both the loss and a life worth living.

## The gift in grief

This isn't toxic positivity or "everything happens for a reason."

But grief, honestly met, does offer something:

- **Depth.** You learn what really matters. The shallow falls away.
- **Compassion.** For yourself, for all suffering beings.
- **Presence.** Grief teaches that time is finite. This moment matters.
- **Connection.** Grief joins you to every human who has lost.
- **Love.** You discover how much you loved. The grief is proportional to the love.

You wouldn't choose grief. But grief, once it comes, can deepen you.

## The way through

There's no around. Only through.

**What through looks like:**
- Feel what you feel when you feel it
- Don't try to skip ahead
- Let the waves come
- Express the grief somehow
- Accept support
- Be patient with yourself
- Know that this will change, even when it feels permanent

Grief is not a problem to solve. It's a passage to navigate.

The other side isn't the absence of grief. It's a new relationship with grief—one where you carry it with you, softened, integrated, part of who you've become.

That's the shape of grief:
Not stages.
Not something you get over.
Not a problem.

Just love, finding its way through loss.

And you, becoming someone who can hold it.
