Integration isn't just something that happens in therapy or on retreat. It's maintained—or lost—through daily practice. What you do regularly either supports wholeness or fragments it further.

Here are practical practices for daily integration.

## Morning Practices

The way you start the day shapes its quality.

### Body Check-In

Before getting out of bed:
- Scan your body from head to toe
- Notice areas of tension, comfort, sensation
- Take a few conscious breaths

This simple practice starts the day embodied rather than immediately mental.

### Intention Setting

Not goals—intentions. How do you want to be today?

"Today I intend to stay present during difficult moments."
"Today I intend to listen more than I speak."

An intention orients attention.

### Movement

Some morning movement—stretching, yoga, walking, exercise—before sitting at a desk.

The body needs to wake up and move. Starting with stillness then sitting leads to sluggishness.

### Minimal Phone

Don't reach for phone immediately. Even 15-30 minutes of non-digital morning supports integration.

Starting with input and stimulation fragments attention before it has a chance to collect.

## Throughout the Day

### Micro-Pauses

Brief moments of presence scattered through the day:
- Three conscious breaths before a meeting
- Noticing feet on ground while waiting
- Brief body scan during transitions

These prevent accumulation of fragmentation.

### Emotion Check-Ins

Periodically ask: "What am I feeling right now?"

Not analyzing—just noticing. Staying current with emotional state rather than deferring awareness.

### Body Breaks

Sitting all day fragments the body from awareness.

- Stand and stretch hourly
- Take walking breaks
- Change positions frequently

The body is always present—stay connected to it.

### Boundary Moments

At transitions (leaving work, before dinner, ending a task), take a moment to complete and shift:

"That's done. Now I'm entering this."

Clean transitions prevent bleeding of one context into another.

## Evening Practices

### Review and Release

Brief evening reflection:
- What happened today that was significant?
- What emotions need acknowledgment?
- What am I carrying that I can set down?

Not rumination—processing. Letting the day complete rather than carrying it into sleep.

### Digital Sunset

Some time before sleep without screens. The nervous system needs to wind down.

Reading, gentle stretching, conversation, journaling—calmer activities.

### Gratitude Practice

Not forced positivity—genuine noticing of what was good.

Even on hard days, something was okay. Noticing it balances the negativity bias.

### Body Settling

Before sleep, let the body release:
- Progressive relaxation
- Body scan
- Gentle stretching
- Self-massage

Sleep is integration time. Arriving in a settled body supports better integration during sleep.

## Weekly Practices

### Extended Reflection

Once weekly, longer review:
- What patterns showed up this week?
- What did I learn?
- What needs attention?
- What am I grateful for?

Weekly reflection catches what daily reflection misses.

### Extended Body Practice

One longer session of physical practice—yoga, running, swimming, hiking, whatever you love.

The body needs extended engagement, not just maintenance.

### Nature Time

Time in natural settings weekly. Nature integrates in ways built environments don't.

Even a park helps. True wilderness helps more.

### Social Connection

Genuine connection with people who matter. Not just functional interaction—real relating.

Isolation fragments. Connection integrates.

## Monthly/Seasonal Practices

### Deeper Review

Monthly check-in on larger questions:
- Am I living according to my values?
- What adjustments are needed?
- What's working and what isn't?

Course correction before you've gone too far off path.

### Clearing

Physical and digital decluttering. External order supports internal order.

What can be released? What's accumulated that no longer serves?

### Intention Refresh

Revisit and update intentions. What made sense last month might need adjustment.

## When Practices Become Automatic

The goal is for integration practices to become natural rather than effortful.

You don't think about brushing teeth—it's automatic. Similarly, body check-ins, micro-pauses, and evening review can become default.

This takes time. Months of intentional practice before it becomes natural.

But once established, integration becomes self-maintaining rather than requiring constant effort.

## When You Fall Off

You will stop practicing sometimes. Life gets busy, travel disrupts, illness intervenes.

When you notice you've dropped practices:
- Don't add guilt (that fragments further)
- Just start again
- Start small—one practice, not all
- Build back gradually

The practice isn't perfect adherence. It's returning, again and again.

## Customization

These are templates, not prescriptions. What works for you may be different.

Experiment:
- Which practices resonate?
- What time of day works best?
- What's sustainable for your life?

Build a practice that you'll actually do consistently.

## The Point

Daily integration practice maintains the wholeness that deeper work creates.

Without practice, insight fades. Processing undoes itself. Fragmentation returns.

With practice, integration deepens. Wholeness stabilizes. Life becomes more coherent.

It's not about perfection. It's about direction.

A little daily integration beats occasional intensive work.

Start today. Keep going.
