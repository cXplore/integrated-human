Your anxiety lives in your body.

That racing heart, shallow breathing, tight chest, clenched jaw—these aren't just symptoms. They're the anxiety itself, expressed somatically.

Which means: the body is also where you can shift it.

These exercises bypass the thinking mind (which is usually making things worse anyway) and work directly with your nervous system. They're practical, quick, and surprisingly effective.

## Why somatic approaches work

When you're anxious, your nervous system is in a threat state. The amygdala has sounded the alarm, and your body has mobilized for danger.

The problem: you can't think your way out of this. The threat response happens faster than thought. Trying to logic yourself out of anxiety often makes it worse—now you're anxious AND frustrated that you can't think straight.

Somatic exercises work because they:
- Communicate directly with the nervous system
- Activate the vagus nerve (your calming system)
- Complete the stress cycle the body initiated
- Ground you in present-moment sensory experience
- Interrupt the anxiety loop at the body level

Your body believes what you do more than what you think.

## Quick interventions (under 2 minutes)

When anxiety hits, you need something fast. These work in the moment.

### 1. The Physiological Sigh

The fastest evidence-based way to calm your nervous system. Takes 30 seconds.

**How to do it:**
1. Inhale through your nose
2. At the top, take a second small "sip" of air
3. Long, slow exhale through your mouth (as long as possible)
4. Repeat 2-3 times

**Why it works:** The double inhale maximally inflates the lungs and opens collapsed air sacs. The long exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system. This is what your body naturally does when it sighs—you're just doing it deliberately.

### 2. Cold Water Reset

Cold activates the dive reflex, immediately slowing your heart rate.

**How to do it:**
- Splash cold water on your face
- Run cold water over your wrists for 30 seconds
- Hold ice cubes in your hands

**Quick version:** Even running wrists under cold water for 15 seconds helps.

**Why it works:** Cold triggers the mammalian dive reflex, which overrides the sympathetic (stress) response with a parasympathetic (calming) response. It's an emergency brake for your nervous system.

### 3. Feet on the Floor

Anxiety often pulls you up and out of your body. This brings you back down.

**How to do it:**
1. Feel your feet on the floor
2. Press them down firmly
3. Notice the texture, temperature, pressure
4. Push into the floor like you're standing in sand
5. Feel the ground holding you

**Why it works:** Grounding through the feet activates the lower body and draws energy down from the head. It also engages proprioception—your sense of where you are in space—which is calming.

### 4. Hum or Sigh

Sound vibrates the vagus nerve, activating the calming response.

**How to do it:**
- Hum any note, feeling vibration in chest and throat
- Or: long "voo" sound (like "voodoo") into your chest
- Or: sigh loudly and fully
- Continue for 30-60 seconds

**Why it works:** The vagus nerve runs right past your vocal cords. Humming and toning vibrate it directly, sending calming signals to your brain.

### 5. Shake

Animals discharge stress through shaking. We suppress this. Don't.

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with soft knees
2. Start bouncing gently, letting your whole body shake
3. Let your arms hang loose and wobble
4. Shake for 1-2 minutes
5. Stop and stand still, feeling the settling

**Why it works:** Shaking completes the stress cycle. Your body mobilized energy for action—shaking lets that energy discharge rather than getting stuck.

## Deeper practices (5-15 minutes)

When you have more time, these practices go deeper.

### 6. Extended Exhale Breathing

Longer exhales signal safety to your nervous system.

**How to do it:**
1. Inhale for 4 counts
2. Exhale for 6-8 counts
3. Keep it gentle—no strain
4. Continue for 3-5 minutes

**Variations:**
- 4 in, 7 out
- 4 in, 4 hold, 8 out
- Whatever ratio feels calming (exhale always longer)

**Why it works:** Inhaling activates the sympathetic system. Exhaling activates the parasympathetic. When your exhale is longer, you're telling your body "we're safe."

### 7. Progressive Muscle Relaxation

Tension release that you can't think but can definitely feel.

**How to do it:**
1. Start with your feet—clench tightly for 5 seconds
2. Release completely, notice the relaxation
3. Move to calves—clench, release
4. Continue up: thighs, glutes, belly, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, face
5. End by relaxing your whole body at once

**Tip:** Really exaggerate the tension so the release is dramatic.

**Why it works:** Deliberately tensing muscles and then releasing them teaches your body what relaxation actually feels like. You're also burning off some of the tension your body created for the threat response.

### 8. Butterfly Hug (Self-Havening)

Self-soothing through bilateral touch.

**How to do it:**
1. Cross your arms over your chest, hands on upper arms
2. Alternately tap your upper arms (like a butterfly)
3. Slow, rhythmic tapping
4. Continue for 2-5 minutes

**Variations:**
- Stroke down your arms from shoulder to wrist
- Tap your thighs alternately
- Cross-body tapping (right hand to left knee, alternate)

**Why it works:** Bilateral stimulation engages both hemispheres and helps process stress. Touch releases oxytocin. The crossing of the midline is calming.

### 9. Orienting to Safety

When anxious, your brain thinks there's danger. Show it there isn't.

**How to do it:**
1. Look around the room slowly
2. Really see each thing you look at
3. Name 5 things you can see (out loud if possible)
4. Name 4 things you can feel (texture, temperature, pressure)
5. Name 3 things you can hear
6. Notice: you are here. You are safe. Nothing is wrong right now.

**Tip:** Turn your head slowly. Let your eyes move naturally. Don't rush.

**Why it works:** Your nervous system checks the environment for threats. By deliberately looking around and finding safety, you complete the scan and show your brain: no tiger here.

### 10. Container Exercise

For anxiety that feels overwhelming or "too much."

**How to do it:**
1. Sit comfortably, close your eyes
2. Imagine a container—any container that feels right (box, safe, vault, jar)
3. Make it as strong and secure as you need
4. Imagine putting the anxious thoughts/feelings into the container
5. Close and lock it
6. The contents are safe. You can return to them when ready.
7. Feel the relief of having them contained

**Why it works:** This gives your nervous system permission to not deal with everything right now. You're not suppressing—you're containing, with the intention to return when resourced.

## Body-based anxiety patterns

Different anxiety types live in different body areas. Knowing where yours lands helps you target it.

### Chest anxiety

**Feels like:** Tight chest, can't breathe deeply, pressure, heart pounding

**Target practices:**
- Extended exhale breathing
- Gentle chest stretches (doorway stretch)
- Humming or singing (opens chest)
- Place hand on heart, breathe into the hand

### Throat anxiety

**Feels like:** Lump in throat, hard to swallow, voice tight, words stuck

**Target practices:**
- Humming (vibrates throat)
- Singing or sighing
- Gentle neck stretches
- Lion's breath (stick tongue out, exhale loudly)

### Stomach anxiety

**Feels like:** Butterflies, nausea, tight belly, digestive upset

**Target practices:**
- Belly breathing (hand on belly, breathe into hand)
- Gentle belly massage
- Rocking (sitting, hug knees, rock back and forth)
- Humming the "voo" sound down into belly

### Tension anxiety

**Feels like:** Shoulders up, jaw clenched, muscles tight everywhere

**Target practices:**
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Shaking
- Exaggerated tension then release (scrunch face, release)
- Shake hands vigorously for 30 seconds

### Dissociative anxiety

**Feels like:** Floating, unreal, disconnected, out of body

**Target practices:**
- Feet on floor (grounding)
- Cold water on face/wrists
- Strong sensory input (smell coffee, taste something sour)
- Squeeze muscles hard, feel the body

## Building a daily practice

Crisis tools help in the moment. But building resilience requires daily practice.

### Morning (5 minutes)

Before you check your phone:
1. 5 physiological sighs
2. Gentle stretching or shaking (2 min)
3. Extended exhale breathing (2 min)

This sets your nervous system baseline for the day.

### Throughout the day

**Between tasks:** 3 extended exhale breaths
**Before meals:** 5 slow breaths to shift into "rest and digest"
**When triggered:** Whichever quick intervention works for you
**Hourly:** Quick body scan. Where am I holding? What do I need?

### Evening (5-10 minutes)

Before bed:
1. Shake off the day (literally shake for 1 minute)
2. Progressive muscle relaxation
3. Extended exhale breathing until drowsy

### Weekly

- One longer movement practice (yoga, dance, whatever moves you)
- Time in nature (natural nervous system regulation)
- Cold exposure practice (builds stress resilience)

## What if it doesn't work?

Sometimes anxiety is bigger than these tools. That's information.

**Consider professional support if:**
- Anxiety is constant and severe
- These tools don't touch it
- You're avoiding major life activities
- Panic attacks are frequent
- Physical symptoms are intense
- You have a history of trauma

**Types of support that help:**
- Somatic Experiencing therapy
- EMDR
- Trauma-informed therapy
- Body-based modalities (breathwork, movement therapy)
- Sometimes medication to stabilize enough to do the deeper work

## The body remembers

Here's what I want you to understand:

Your anxiety isn't a malfunction. It's your body trying to protect you. At some point, it learned that vigilance was necessary. It's still doing its job.

Somatic exercises don't fight the anxiety. They communicate with it. They show your body—through direct experience—that right now, in this moment, you are safe.

This isn't about forcing calm. It's about creating the conditions where calm can emerge.

Your body wants to regulate. It knows how. Sometimes it just needs a little help remembering.

These exercises are that help.

Start with one. Practice it when you're NOT anxious. Build the skill. Then use it when you need it.

Your nervous system is listening. What you do with your body speaks louder than what you think with your mind.

So speak to it. Move it. Breathe it. Shake it.

The anxiety won't last forever. Your body knows how to come home.

Help it remember.
