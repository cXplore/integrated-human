"Drink more water" is the most common health advice. And it's incomplete.

You can drink plenty of water and still be dehydrated. You can also drink too much water and dilute your electrolytes. Hydration is more nuanced than "8 glasses a day."

## What hydration actually means

Hydration isn't just water volume. It's water in the right places with the right balance of electrolytes.

Your cells need:
- **Sodium** (extracellular fluid)
- **Potassium** (intracellular fluid)
- **Magnesium** (hundreds of cellular functions)
- **Chloride** (works with sodium)

Without adequate electrolytes, water passes through you without properly hydrating cells. You pee it out. You feel thirsty again quickly.

## Signs you might be dehydrated

Obvious signs:
- Thirst
- Dark urine
- Dry mouth

Less obvious signs:
- Fatigue
- Brain fog
- Headaches
- Muscle cramps
- Dizziness
- Constipation
- Hunger (often confused with thirst)
- Afternoon energy crash
- Poor workout performance

Many people walk around mildly dehydrated, attributing the symptoms to other causes.

## Why water alone isn't enough

### The electrolyte problem

If you drink lots of plain water without electrolytes:
- You dilute blood sodium
- Your body releases water to restore balance
- You pee more
- Net hydration doesn't improve much

This is especially true if:
- You sweat a lot
- You drink coffee or alcohol
- You eat a low-sodium diet
- You do intermittent fasting
- You're on a low-carb diet

### Modern diets miss the mark

Our ancestors got electrolytes from food, blood, and natural water sources. We get processed foods that are either too high in sodium with no potassium, or "healthy" low-sodium foods that leave us deficient.

The ratio matters: traditional diets had roughly equal sodium and potassium. Modern diets have way more sodium than potassium.

## How to actually hydrate

### Step 1: Start with salt

If you eat a whole-foods diet and aren't adding salt, you might be sodium deficient, especially if you exercise.

Try adding a pinch of sea salt or mineral salt to your morning water. If you feel better, you needed it.

### Step 2: Get potassium from food

High-potassium foods:
- Avocado
- Leafy greens
- Potatoes (with skin)
- Bananas
- Coconut water
- Fish

Most people get far too little potassium.

### Step 3: Address magnesium

Magnesium deficiency is extremely common. Signs:
- Muscle cramps
- Poor sleep
- Anxiety
- Chocolate cravings

Food sources: dark chocolate, nuts, seeds, leafy greens.

Supplement: Magnesium glycinate or citrate, 200-400mg.

### Step 4: Make electrolyte drinks

Simple recipe:
- 16 oz water
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- Squeeze of lemon or lime
- Optional: splash of fruit juice for potassium

Or buy electrolyte mixes without sugar (LMNT, Drip Drop, etc.).

## How much to drink

There's no universal answer. It depends on:
- Your size
- Activity level
- Climate
- Diet
- How much you sweat

### Better than counting ounces:

**Check your urine**: Pale yellow is ideal. Clear might mean over-hydrating. Dark yellow means drink more.

**Drink when thirsty**: Thirst is a signal. Don't ignore it, but don't force water constantly either.

**Front-load hydration**: Drink more in the morning and earlier in the day. Reduce before bed to avoid disrupting sleep.

**Drink around exercise**: Before, during (if long/intense), and after.

## Common hydration mistakes

### Drinking too much

Yes, this is possible. Overhydration dilutes sodium (hyponatremia). Symptoms:
- Nausea
- Headache
- Confusion
- In severe cases, dangerous

Athletes and people who force excessive water are at risk.

### Relying on coffee

Coffee is mildly diuretic but moderate consumption doesn't dehydrate you significantly. Still, it shouldn't be your only fluid.

### Ignoring electrolytes during fasting

When you don't eat, you don't get dietary sodium, potassium, or magnesium. If you fast and feel terrible, try adding electrolytes.

### Thinking all drinks hydrate equally

Alcohol: Dehydrating
Sugary drinks: Can spike blood sugar, not ideal
Fruit juice: High sugar
Sports drinks: Often too much sugar, designed for extreme athletes

Water and electrolyte-balanced drinks are best.

## Special situations

### If you exercise heavily

You lose significant sodium and some potassium through sweat. Plain water doesn't replace this. Use electrolyte drinks during and after intense or long exercise.

### If you're on low-carb/keto

Carbs help retain water and sodium. When you cut carbs, you excrete more water and sodium. Increase salt intake intentionally.

### If you drink alcohol

Alcohol suppresses vasopressin, causing you to urinate more. For every alcoholic drink, you lose more water than you take in.

Counter: Drink water between alcoholic drinks. Electrolytes before bed.

### If you travel by plane

Cabin air is extremely dry. You lose water through breathing. Drink more before and during flights. Avoid alcohol.

## The test

For one week:
1. Add a pinch of salt to your morning water
2. Ensure you're getting potassium-rich foods
3. Consider magnesium supplementation
4. Don't force excessive water, but don't ignore thirst

Track how you feel: energy, brain clarity, mood, workout performance.

Many people find significant improvement from optimizing hydration, not just water volume.

## The simple takeaway

Hydration = water + electrolytes in balance.

Don't just drink more water. Drink smarter water. Pay attention to what your body tells you.

Sometimes the fatigue, brain fog, or headache you've been attributing to something complex has a simple solution.

Start with the basics. They matter more than you think.
