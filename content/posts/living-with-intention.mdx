Most people live by default. They didn't choose their life—it accumulated. The job that appeared. The habits that formed. The path that unfolded without design.

Living with intention is different: consciously choosing how you spend your days and your life.

## Default vs. Intentional

**Default living:**
- Following paths laid by others
- Reacting to circumstances
- Drifting with currents
- Not asking what you actually want
- Ending up somewhere without choosing it

**Intentional living:**
- Conscious choice about direction
- Proactive creation
- Swimming with purpose
- Knowing what you want and moving toward it
- Ending up somewhere you chose

Neither is good or bad universally. But default living often leads to looking up one day and wondering how you got here.

## What Intention Means

Intention is:
- Knowing what you value
- Knowing what you want to create
- Aligning action with purpose
- Making conscious choices
- Taking responsibility for direction

It's bringing awareness to what often happens unconsciously.

## The Cost of Default

Living by default:
- May not reflect your values
- Gives control to external forces
- Creates regret ("I wish I had...")
- Leads to misalignment
- Makes you passenger, not driver

Default isn't neutral. It hands your life to circumstances.

## Creating Intention

### Clarify Values

What actually matters to you? Not what should matter—what does?

Values are the foundation. Intention without values is directionless.

### Articulate Vision

What life are you creating? What do you want your days to contain?

This doesn't need to be perfectly clear. Some direction is enough to start.

### Set Intentions

Not just goals—intentions. How do you want to be, not just what do you want to achieve?

"I intend to be present in my relationships."
"I intend to create rather than consume."
"I intend to prioritize health."

### Align Actions

Does your daily action match your intention?

If not, adjust either action or intention. Misalignment is just deferred unhappiness.

### Review Regularly

Intention drifts. Regular review:
- Are you living your intentions?
- Have intentions changed?
- What adjustment is needed?

Monthly or quarterly review keeps intention alive.

## Intention and Flexibility

Intention isn't rigid:
- Intentions can change as you change
- Life circumstances require adaptation
- Being too fixed becomes its own problem

Hold intention firmly enough to guide and loosely enough to flow.

## Intention in Daily Life

Big picture intention matters. So does daily intention:

**Morning.** What's the intention for today? How do you want to be?

**Before activities.** What's the intention for this meeting, conversation, task?

**Transitions.** What's the intention for this phase of the day?

Daily intention keeps you present and purposeful.

## Obstacles to Intention

**Not knowing what you want.** Start with what you don't want. Work backward.

**Fear of commitment.** Intention can change. You're not locked in forever.

**Overwhelm.** Start with one area of life. Build from there.

**Forgetting.** Intention needs reminders. Systems that prompt awareness.

## Intention and Control

Intention isn't control. You don't control outcomes. You do influence direction.

Set intention for what you can affect. Release attachment to what you can't.

## Living the Questions

You don't need complete answers to live intentionally.

Living the questions is itself intentional:
- "What do I want?"
- "What matters?"
- "What am I creating?"

Holding the questions keeps you awake.

## The Gift of Intention

A life lived with intention:
- Feels more yours
- Has more meaning
- Holds less regret
- Creates more alignment
- Wakes you up

This doesn't mean every moment is perfectly designed. It means you're choosing direction rather than drifting.

## Beginning

Right now:
- What's your intention for today?
- What's your intention for this year?
- What's your intention for your life?

Even rough answers start the process.

Then: live it. Review it. Adjust it. Continue.

Your life is the one you're living.

Make it intentional.

Make it yours.
