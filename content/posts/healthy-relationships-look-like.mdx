If you grew up in dysfunction, you might not have a template for healthy relationships. You know what you don't want, but not what you do want.

Here's what healthy actually looks like.

## Safety

You can be yourself without fear of punishment. You can express disagreement. You can have bad days. You can make mistakes.

Safety doesn't mean no conflict — it means conflict doesn't threaten the relationship's foundation.

## Mutual respect

Both people's needs, opinions, and boundaries matter. Neither person is consistently more important than the other.

Disagreement is possible without contempt.

## Individual identity

You're two whole people, not two halves making a whole. You have your own interests, friendships, and time apart.

Togetherness is a choice, not a cage.

## Honest communication

You can say what you mean. Difficult topics can be discussed. Feedback can be given and received.

No mind-reading required.

## Repair after conflict

Conflict happens. In healthy relationships, there's a path back — acknowledgment, accountability, reconnection.

Ruptures are followed by repairs.

## Growth support

Each person supports the other's growth, even when it's inconvenient or challenging.

You want the other person to become their fullest self.

## Reciprocity

Give and take roughly balance over time. Not perfectly even, but not consistently one-sided.

Both people invest. Both people receive.

## Physical and emotional safety

No violence or threats. Emotional abuse isn't present. Both people feel secure.

This is non-negotiable.

## What healthy is NOT

Healthy isn't:
- Perfect harmony (conflict is normal)
- Constant happiness (life has seasons)
- Never feeling negative emotions
- Agreeing on everything
- Complete merger of identities

Healthy is two imperfect people navigating life together with respect, honesty, and care.

## If you've never seen it

You can learn it. Through reading, therapy, observation, and practice.

It may feel unfamiliar at first. Uncomfortable even. That's okay.

Keep moving toward health. It's worth it.
