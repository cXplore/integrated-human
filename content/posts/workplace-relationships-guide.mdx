The workplace is a relationship ecosystem. You didn't choose these people. You can't easily leave. And your livelihood depends on navigating these dynamics well.

Most career problems are relationship problems. Most career success is relationship success.

## The unique challenges

### Forced proximity
You're thrown together with people you might never choose.

### Power dynamics
Hierarchy complicates everything.

### Stakes are high
Relationships affect your income, opportunities, and daily stress levels.

## Key relationships

### Your manager
The most impactful relationship on your daily work experience.

**What helps:** Understand their priorities. Communicate in their preferred style. Make their job easier. Don't make them guess what you need.

### Your peers
Often the most complex because there's collaboration and competition.

**What helps:** Generosity with credit and help. Reliability. Addressing tensions directly rather than gossiping.

### Cross-functional relationships
**What helps:** Build relationships before you need something. Understanding their constraints and priorities.

## Common problems

### Conflict with a colleague
Check your interpretation. Assume positive intent initially. Address directly, not through others.

### Difficult manager
Options: Adapt to their style. Influence if they're receptive. Transfer teams. Leave if severe enough.

### Politics and gossip
Build broad, genuine relationships. Don't participate in gossip. Keep confidences.

## Communication fundamentals

- Default to clarity
- Give feedback using: specific behavior, impact, request
- Receive feedback without defending

## Boundaries at work

Your job has boundaries. It's okay to say no to work outside your role, push back on unrealistic timelines, and not check email at 11pm.

## Building strong relationships

Be reliable. Be helpful. Be honest. Be appreciative. Be human.

Careers span decades. The relationships you build now echo forward.
