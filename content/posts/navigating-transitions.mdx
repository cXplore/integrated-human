Life is punctuated by transitions: career changes, relationship shifts, life stage passages, moves, losses, beginnings. These in-between times are challenging—and also transformative.

How you navigate transitions determines what you become on the other side.

## What Transitions Are

Transitions aren't just changes in external circumstance. They're psychological passages:

**Ending.** Letting go of what was.
**In-between.** The liminal space where old is gone and new hasn't arrived.
**New beginning.** Emerging into what comes next.

Each phase has its own challenges and gifts.

## Common Transitions

- Career change or job loss
- Relationship beginning or ending
- Becoming a parent
- Children leaving home
- Aging and health changes
- Loss of loved ones
- Moves and relocations
- Life stage shifts (entering adulthood, midlife, elder years)

These are predictable—yet each one feels unique.

## The Ending Phase

Before new can come, old must end:
- Letting go of identity that was tied to what's passing
- Grieving what's lost
- Releasing attachments to how things were
- Accepting that this chapter is closing

Endings are losses even when the change is positive.

Allow the grief. Don't rush to the new before you've honored what's ending.

## The In-Between

The liminal space—after the old, before the new:
- Uncertainty about what's coming
- Identity confusion (who am I now?)
- Disorientation
- Impulse to fill the void quickly

This space is uncomfortable but valuable. It's where transformation happens.

Don't rush through it. Don't distract from it. Let it do its work.

## The New Beginning

Emergence into what's next:
- New identity forming
- New routines establishing
- New possibilities opening
- Energy returning

Beginnings are often fragile. Protect them. Nurture them.

## Navigating Well

### Honor Each Phase

Give each phase its due:
- Endings need grief
- In-between needs patience
- Beginnings need nurturing

Don't skip phases. What's skipped will catch up with you.

### Lower Expectations

During transitions, you're not at full capacity. Expect less of yourself. Keep basics running. Don't demand peak performance.

### Get Support

Transitions are easier with support:
- People who've been through similar changes
- Professional help if needed
- Community that holds you

Don't isolate during transitions.

### Create Rituals

Mark the transition:
- Endings: ceremonies of release, completion
- In-between: reflection, retreat
- Beginnings: celebrations, initiations

Rituals help psyche process what's happening.

### Trust the Process

Transitions feel chaotic but often follow patterns:
- The disorientation is normal
- The uncertainty is temporary
- Something is emerging even when you can't see it

Trust that you'll come through.

## Common Mistakes

**Rushing.** Trying to get through quickly. Missing the work of each phase.

**Staying stuck.** Not moving at all. Getting trapped in the in-between.

**Avoiding grief.** Skipping the emotional work of endings.

**Premature commitment.** Grabbing the first new thing to escape uncertainty.

**Isolation.** Going through alone when support is available.

## Transitions as Opportunity

Every transition is an opportunity:
- To shed what no longer serves
- To clarify what matters
- To become more yourself
- To grow in ways that comfort never allows

The difficulty is the doorway.

## Identity Through Transition

Transitions challenge identity:
- Who am I without that role?
- Who am I without that relationship?
- Who am I in this new phase?

The answer: you're who you're becoming. Identity is dynamic, not fixed. Transitions reveal this.

## After Transition

When you come through:
- New stability establishes
- New identity settles
- Lessons integrate
- Capacity expands

You're not who you were before. You couldn't be.

## Beginning

If you're in transition now:
- Which phase are you in? (ending, in-between, beginning)
- What does this phase need from you?
- What support would help?
- What's the next small step?

If you're not in transition:
- What transition might be approaching?
- How can you prepare?

Transitions will come. The question is how you'll meet them.

Meet them well. They're shaping who you become.
