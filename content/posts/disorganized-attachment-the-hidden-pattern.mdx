You want love. You pursue it. Things start going well.

Then the fear kicks in. Something shifts. You pull away. Or you sabotage. Or you pick a fight. Or you just... disappear.

Later, you're devastated. You didn't want that. You don't know why you did it. You promised yourself this time would be different.

But then someone new shows interest, and the cycle begins again. Toward, then away. Hope, then fear. Connection, then destruction.

This is disorganized attachment—also called fearful-avoidant. It's the least understood attachment style, the most painful, and often the most hidden.

## What is disorganized attachment?

Disorganized attachment develops when the source of safety (the caregiver) was also a source of fear. This creates an impossible situation: the child needs to approach for safety, but approaching triggers fear.

The result is a system with no coherent strategy. Approach? Dangerous. Avoid? Unbearable. The child oscillates between both, with no resolution.

In adult relationships, this becomes:
- Wanting intimacy but fearing it
- Pursuing, then withdrawing
- Craving closeness, then feeling suffocated
- Rapid shifts between anxious and avoidant behaviors
- Relationships marked by chaos and confusion

## The push-pull experience

Disorganized attachment feels like having two operating systems fighting for control.

**The approaching system says:**
- "I need connection"
- "I don't want to be alone"
- "Please don't leave"
- "Love me"

**The avoiding system says:**
- "They'll hurt me"
- "I need to get out"
- "It's not safe"
- "Push them away before they push you"

These two systems alternate, sometimes moment to moment. You're pursuing intensely—then suddenly need space. You're close and connected—then terrified and distant.

Partners find this bewildering. One day you're all in; the next you're gone. You find it bewildering too.

## Signs of disorganized attachment

### In relationships:

- **Intense desire for closeness paired with intense fear of it**
- **Rapid shifts** between anxious behaviors (pursuing, needing reassurance) and avoidant behaviors (withdrawing, needing space)
- **Sabotaging relationships** when they get good—picking fights, creating distance, cheating, disappearing
- **Difficulty regulating emotions** in relationships—big reactions to small triggers
- **Fear of abandonment AND fear of engulfment**—both feel dangerous
- **Confusion about what you want**—changing constantly
- **Turbulent relationships**—lots of conflict, breakups and reconciliations
- **Choosing partners who confirm fears**—people who are unavailable or harmful

### General patterns:

- **Difficulty trusting anyone**—even when they've proven trustworthy
- **Dissociation** during intimacy or conflict
- **Negative view of self AND others**—"I'm unlovable" and "people can't be trusted"
- **Emotion dysregulation**—intense emotions, difficulty calming down
- **Identity confusion**—not knowing who you are
- **History of trauma or abuse**—often in childhood

### The sabotage pattern

A hallmark of disorganized attachment is sabotaging relationships that are going well:

1. Relationship develops, connection deepens
2. This triggers fear (intimacy is dangerous)
3. Unconscious need to create distance or destroy the relationship
4. Sabotage behavior: fight, withdrawal, infidelity, leaving
5. Relationship ends or becomes conflictual
6. Relief (fear is reduced) + grief (loss of what you wanted)
7. Pattern repeats

You often don't see the sabotage until afterward. In the moment, it feels like you're responding to something they did, or protecting yourself, or following your feelings.

## What causes disorganized attachment?

### Fright without solution

The core dynamic is a caregiver who was both source of safety and source of fear.

This creates an impossible problem: the attachment system says "go to caregiver for comfort." But the fear system says "get away from danger." When the caregiver IS the danger, there's no solution.

The system fragments. Neither approach nor avoidance works. The child develops disorganized, contradictory patterns.

### Common origins

**Abuse by caregivers**
Physical, sexual, or severe emotional abuse. The person you need is the person hurting you.

**Frightening caregiver behavior**
Not necessarily abuse, but a caregiver who was scary—rage, unpredictability, threatening behavior.

**Caregiver's unresolved trauma**
A parent who is dissociative, has PTSD, or is dealing with unprocessed trauma can be frightening to children even without abuse. Their dissociation or fear responses are confusing and alarming.

**Neglect**
Severe neglect where needs went persistently unmet.

**Loss of caregiver**
Death or prolonged separation from a primary attachment figure, especially if not properly processed.

**Chaotic environment**
Domestic violence, addiction, mental illness in the home—environments where safety was never stable.

### Not always remembered

Many people with disorganized attachment don't have clear memories of trauma. The events happened early, or were chronic rather than acute, or have been dissociated. You might have a "normal" childhood story but attachment patterns that suggest otherwise.

The body remembers what the mind may not.

## The inner experience

Living with disorganized attachment is exhausting and confusing.

### The constant conflict

You're at war with yourself. Part of you wants love; part of you wants to run. Part of you trusts; part of you expects betrayal. Part of you feels deserving; part of you feels unlovable.

There's no peace, no settled sense of what you want or who you are.

### The shame

Disorganized attachment often carries deep shame:
- Shame about your needs
- Shame about your fear
- Shame about sabotaging good things
- Shame about the chaos in your relationships
- Shame about your history

This shame compounds the problem—it confirms the belief that you're fundamentally broken.

### The dissociation

When intimacy or conflict becomes overwhelming, you might check out—go numb, feel unreal, disconnect from your body. This is a survival response, but it makes it hard to stay present in relationships or process what's happening.

### The confusion

You often don't know what you feel or want. Emotions are intense but hard to identify. You might feel one thing, do another, and later wonder what happened.

Others seem to have stable preferences, consistent desires. You feel like you're made of fragments that won't cohere.

## How disorganized attachment affects relationships

### Chaos is familiar

Stable, peaceful relationships feel wrong—boring, suspicious, or suffocating. Chaos feels like home, even when you hate it.

You might unconsciously create drama to return to familiar territory. Or choose partners who provide chaos naturally.

### Testing to destruction

You test whether partners will stay. The tests escalate—each passed test leads to a harder test. Eventually, you test to destruction, proving what you suspected: they'll leave.

This isn't conscious manipulation. It's a desperate, unconscious attempt to know if this person is safe. The tragedy is that the testing itself drives people away.

### Confusion for partners

Partners of disorganized people are often deeply confused:
- "You said you wanted closeness—now you're pushing me away"
- "We were happy—what happened?"
- "I don't know what you want from me"
- "One day you're all in, the next you're gone"

This confusion often turns to frustration, and eventually to leaving—confirming your fears.

### The trauma bond trap

Disorganized attachment makes you vulnerable to trauma bonds—intense attachments to people who aren't good for you. The chaos, the intensity, the fear-and-relief cycles—these feel like love because they match your internal experience of what love is.

## How to heal disorganized attachment

Healing disorganized attachment is possible, but it's harder than healing anxious or avoidant patterns. It requires addressing both the attachment wounds AND often the underlying trauma.

### 1. Safety first

Before anything else: current safety.
- Are you in a dangerous relationship now?
- Do you have stable housing, income, basic security?
- Do you have people you can call in crisis?

Healing attachment while currently unsafe isn't possible. Secure your foundation first.

### 2. Professional support is essential

Disorganized attachment usually requires professional help. The patterns are complex, the wounds are deep, and trying to heal alone often leads to retraumatization.

Look for:
- **Trauma-informed therapists**
- **Attachment-focused therapy**
- **EMDR** (for processing traumatic memories)
- **Somatic therapies** (the body holds trauma)
- **IFS (Internal Family Systems)** (for working with conflicted parts)

This isn't optional. It's central to healing.

### 3. Learn to recognize your states

With disorganized attachment, you shift between states rapidly—anxious, avoidant, flooded, dissociated. Learning to recognize where you are is essential.

Practice noticing:
- "I'm in my anxious part right now—wanting reassurance"
- "I'm in my avoidant part—wanting to flee"
- "I'm dissociating—checking out"
- "I'm flooded—can't think clearly"

This recognition creates space between the state and the action.

### 4. Develop regulation skills

Your nervous system is chronically dysregulated. Building regulation skills is crucial:

**For activation (anxious/flooded):**
- Extended exhales
- Cold water on face
- Grounding (feet on floor, name what you see)
- Movement to discharge energy

**For shutdown (avoidant/dissociated):**
- Gentle movement
- Orienting to environment
- Touch (self-holding, weighted blanket)
- Connection with safe other

**Daily practices:**
- Regular breathwork
- Body-based practices (yoga, somatic work)
- Reducing stimulants and depressants
- Prioritizing sleep

### 5. Work with parts

Disorganized attachment often feels like being multiple people. Parts work (like IFS) can help.

You might have:
- An anxious part that craves love
- An avoidant part that fears engulfment
- A saboteur that destroys good things
- A young part frozen in original trauma
- A protector that keeps people away

These parts have reasons for existing. They're trying to help, using strategies that made sense once. Healing involves understanding them, appreciating their intent, and helping them update their strategies.

### 6. Process underlying trauma

Disorganized attachment is usually rooted in trauma. At some point, that trauma needs processing—not just talking about, but metabolizing in the body.

Approaches that help:
- EMDR
- Somatic Experiencing
- Trauma-sensitive yoga
- Carefully facilitated psychedelic therapy
- Body-based therapies

This should happen with professional support. Processing trauma alone can be destabilizing.

### 7. Build a coherent narrative

Part of healing is making sense of your story. What happened? How did it affect you? How did you adapt?

This narrative doesn't excuse harmful behavior from others or yourself. It contextualizes it. It helps you understand why you are how you are—and that it makes sense given what you experienced.

### 8. Earn secure attachment through relationship

Ultimately, attachment heals in relationship. But not just any relationship.

You need:
- A relationship where you feel safe (therapy relationship counts)
- Consistent, non-threatening presence
- Someone who stays through your push-pull
- Rupture and repair—small breaches that get healed

Over time, these experiences create new templates. The body learns that closeness doesn't always mean danger. Trust becomes possible.

## Choosing partners wisely

While healing, partner selection matters enormously.

**Helpful partners:**
- Secure attachment (calm under pressure, consistent)
- Patient with your process
- Own their own work
- Able to hold boundaries without abandoning
- Regulate their own emotions

**Harmful partners:**
- Also disorganized (chaos amplified)
- Dismissive or punishing of your struggles
- Avoidant who can't meet your needs
- Anyone who reminds you of original trauma
- People who exploit your vulnerability

You might not be attracted to healthy partners initially. They might feel boring compared to the intensity you're used to. Learning to feel attraction to safety is part of the work.

## Hope and patience

Disorganized attachment is the hardest pattern to heal. It's often rooted in trauma. It involves the most internal conflict.

But it's not a life sentence.

People with disorganized attachment do heal. They form secure relationships. They find peace in intimacy. The chaos quiets. The internal war ends.

It takes time—usually years, not months. It takes professional help. It takes practice and patience and courage.

But it's possible.

The parts of you that learned love was dangerous can learn something new. The body that expects harm can learn safety. The heart that pushes away can learn to receive.

You're not broken. You're adapted to something terrible. Now you can adapt to something better.

That's not a flaw. That's resilience finally working for you instead of against you.
