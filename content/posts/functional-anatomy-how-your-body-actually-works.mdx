You live in a body you probably don't understand.

Most people can name major organs but don't know how they move, what supports what, or why certain things hurt. This ignorance makes it hard to take care of yourself—and easy to get injured or stuck.

You don't need a medical degree. But understanding how your body actually works changes everything.

## The skeleton: your frame

Your skeleton does three main jobs:
1. Structure: Holds you up
2. Protection: Shields vital organs
3. Movement: Provides attachment points for muscles

### The spine

Your spine isn't a straight pole—it's an S-curve with natural curves in the neck (cervical), mid-back (thoracic), and low back (lumbar). These curves are shock absorbers.

**Key points:**
- 24 moveable vertebrae (7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar)
- Between each vertebra: a disc (cushion)
- The spine can flex, extend, rotate, and side-bend
- No single "correct" posture—the spine needs varied movement

**Common problems:** Flattening or exaggerating the curves. Prolonged positions. Disc problems when loaded with twisted/flexed spine under pressure.

### The pelvis

The pelvis is the base of your spine and the connector to your legs. It's not one bone but several fused together.

**Key points:**
- Tilts forward (anterior) and backward (posterior)
- Most people have some imbalance
- Pelvic position affects everything above (spine) and below (legs)
- Important for core stability and hip function

### The shoulder complex

Your shoulder isn't just the ball-and-socket joint. It's four joints working together: the glenohumeral (ball-and-socket), acromioclavicular (collar bone to shoulder blade), sternoclavicular (collar bone to chest), and scapulothoracic (shoulder blade on ribcage).

**Key points:**
- Incredibly mobile—but less stable
- Shoulder blade position and movement matter as much as the joint
- Many shoulder problems are really shoulder blade problems
- The rotator cuff stabilizes the joint

### The hip complex

Your hip is a ball-and-socket joint—the femur (thigh) head sits in the pelvis socket.

**Key points:**
- Deep, stable joint (unlike shoulder)
- Allows flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction
- Needs mobility—most people are tight here
- Hip problems often show up as back or knee problems

## The muscular system: your movers

Muscles do three things:
1. Produce movement
2. Stabilize joints
3. Generate heat

### How muscles work

Muscles contract—they pull, they don't push. Movement happens through coordinated contraction and relaxation of opposing muscle groups.

**Key concepts:**
- Agonist: the muscle doing the work
- Antagonist: the opposing muscle (relaxes while agonist contracts)
- Synergist: helpers
- Stabilizers: hold things still so movers can move

### Major muscle groups

**Core:** Not just "abs"—the entire cylinder of muscles around your trunk. Includes rectus abdominis, obliques, transverse abdominis, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, and deep stabilizers.

**Glutes:** Your butt—the most powerful muscles in your body. Crucial for hip extension, stability, and power. Chronically underused in sitting culture.

**Quads:** Front of thigh—extend the knee. Often overworked compared to posterior chain.

**Hamstrings:** Back of thigh—flex the knee, extend the hip. Often tight and weak simultaneously.

**Lats:** The large back muscles—pull things toward you, stabilize the shoulder.

**Pecs:** Chest—push, bring arms together.

### Common imbalances

Modern life creates predictable imbalances:
- Tight hip flexors (from sitting)
- Weak glutes (from not using them)
- Tight chest, weak upper back (from hunching)
- Weak core (from not challenging it)
- Tight neck (from screens)

These imbalances cause pain and limit movement.

## The fascial system: your container

Fascia is the connective tissue that surrounds everything—muscles, organs, nerves. It's one continuous system throughout the body.

**Key points:**
- Fascia can get stuck, restricted, adhered
- Restrictions in one area affect distant areas
- Hydration and movement keep fascia healthy
- Fascia explains why pain often appears distant from its source

## The nervous system: your controller

Everything in the body is controlled by the nervous system.

**Key points:**
- Central: brain and spinal cord
- Peripheral: nerves throughout the body
- Autonomic: controls involuntary functions (heart, digestion, etc.)
- Motor: controls movement
- Sensory: receives input

### The autonomic nervous system

This matters enormously for wellbeing:
- Sympathetic: fight/flight/freeze (activation)
- Parasympathetic: rest/digest (calm)
- Vagal: complex regulation of both

Most people are stuck in sympathetic dominance—chronic activation. This affects everything.

## Systems integration

### Everything is connected

The body isn't separate parts—it's one integrated system.

**Examples:**
- Foot position affects knee, hip, back, neck
- Breathing patterns affect posture and nervous system
- Hip mobility affects low back and shoulder
- Fascia connects distant parts

This is why local treatment often fails—the problem is in the system, not one part.

### Movement chains

Movement uses chains of muscles working together:
- **Posterior chain:** Glutes, hamstrings, back muscles—crucial for power
- **Anterior chain:** Hip flexors, quads, abs—often overdeveloped
- **Lateral chain:** Side body—often neglected

Training isolated muscles without training chains misses how the body actually works.

## Practical implications

### For movement

- Train movements, not just muscles
- Balance front and back, left and right
- Include all planes of movement (forward/back, side-to-side, rotation)
- Respect the body's design

### For pain

- Look beyond the pain location
- Consider the whole system
- Address imbalances, not just symptoms
- Build capacity, not just reduce pain

### For daily life

- Vary positions frequently
- Use your body throughout the day
- Respect biomechanics (don't twist and lift under load)
- Stay mobile—the body is designed to move

### For healing

- Understanding anatomy empowers you
- You can communicate with practitioners
- You can self-assess and self-treat (carefully)
- You know when something's wrong
