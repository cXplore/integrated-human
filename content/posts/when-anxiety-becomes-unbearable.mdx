Your nervous system has its own language. Learning to work with it—rather than fight it—is one of the most useful skills you can develop.

Here are practical techniques for calming anxiety and restoring a sense of ease.

## Right Now (Do This First)

Look around the room. Find:
- **5 things you can see** (name them silently or aloud)
- **4 things you can touch** (touch them)
- **3 things you can hear**
- **2 things you can smell**
- **1 thing you can taste**

This isn't a cure. It's an anchor. It helps your brain realize you're here, now, and safe.

## What's Happening in Your Body

Your nervous system has activated its threat response. This is ancient survival hardware doing exactly what it was designed to do—prepare you to fight or flee.

The problem is there's nothing to fight or flee from. So the energy has nowhere to go.

**What you're feeling is terrifying but not dangerous.** Panic attacks and anxiety spikes cannot hurt you, even though they feel like they will.

## Breathing (If You Can)

Don't force deep breaths if they make it worse. Instead:

- **Exhale longer than you inhale** (in for 4, out for 6-8)
- **Breathe out through pursed lips** like you're blowing through a straw
- **Slow down** rather than trying to breathe deeply

The exhale activates your calm-down system. Even slightly longer exhales help.

## If You're Having a Panic Attack

Panic attacks typically last 10-30 minutes. They peak and then decline. They always end.

**During the peak:**
- Don't fight it—this often makes it worse
- Remind yourself: "This is panic. It will pass."
- Focus on the ground under your feet
- Cold water on wrists or face can help
- It's okay to pace or move

**What won't happen (even though it feels like it will):**
- You won't die
- You won't go crazy
- You won't lose control
- Your heart won't stop
- You won't stop breathing

Your body knows how to survive this. It's surviving it right now.

## When the Intensity Is Overwhelming

If you're at a 10/10 intensity:

**Movement helps.** Walk around. Shake your hands. Do jumping jacks if you can. The body needs to move the energy.

**Cold helps.** Ice on the back of your neck. Cold water on your face. Hold ice cubes.

**Pressure helps.** Wrap yourself tightly in a blanket. Press against a wall. Have someone hold you firmly (if that feels safe).

**Sound helps.** Hum loudly. Make a "voo" sound. Growl. Your own voice can regulate your nervous system.

## After the Peak

Once the worst has passed:
- Drink some water
- Eat something if you can
- Rest—your body just went through something intense
- Don't try to figure out why it happened right now
- Be gentle with yourself for the rest of the day

## What Makes Anxiety Worse

Avoid these during high anxiety:
- Caffeine
- Sugar spikes (followed by crashes)
- Scrolling news or social media
- Trying to "think through" the anxiety
- Fighting the physical sensations
- Demanding that you calm down

## If This Keeps Happening

Frequent intense anxiety or panic attacks are signals that something needs attention. This could be:

- Chronic stress exceeding your capacity
- Unprocessed trauma
- A nervous system stuck in threat mode
- An anxiety disorder that responds to treatment
- Physical factors (thyroid, hormones, medication effects)

You don't have to figure it out alone. Anxiety is one of the most treatable conditions that exists.

## Right Now

If you're in the middle of it:
- This will end. It always ends.
- You've survived every panic attack so far.
- Your body is not your enemy—it's trying to protect you.
- You can get through the next few minutes.

Focus on the next breath. Then the next one. Time will pass. The intensity will decrease.

You're going to be okay.
