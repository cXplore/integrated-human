You know what you want. You've thought about it, maybe written it down. You want a partner who's emotionally available, consistent, kind, stable.

Then you meet someone available, consistent, kind, stable—and you're bored. Something's missing. There's no spark.

So you end up with someone unavailable, inconsistent, complicated, chaotic. And you have all the spark in the world.

This isn't bad luck. It's a pattern. And until you understand it, you'll keep repeating it.

## The Desire-Pursuit Gap

There's what you consciously want. And there's what you actually pursue.

**You want:** stability, security, someone who chooses you clearly
**You pursue:** ambiguity, uncertainty, someone who keeps you guessing

**You want:** emotional availability, depth, real intimacy
**You pursue:** unavailable people who give just enough to keep you hooked

**You want:** to be someone's priority
**You pursue:** people who treat you as an option

**You want:** calm, ease, mature love
**You pursue:** drama, intensity, the rollercoaster

This gap between stated desire and actual behavior isn't hypocrisy. It's unconscious programming running the show while you think you're making free choices.

## Why We Chase What Hurts Us

Several forces drive the gap:

### Familiarity Feels Like Love

Your nervous system learned what "love" feels like from your earliest experiences. If love came with anxiety, inconsistency, or having to earn it—that's what love feels like to you.

When you meet someone healthy, they don't trigger those familiar sensations. It doesn't feel like love. It feels like something's missing.

When you meet someone who recreates your early dynamics, your body recognizes it. "Ah, this is love." The spark is actually recognition—your nervous system saying "I know this dance."

### Unfinished Business

We're drawn to relive what we haven't resolved.

If a parent was emotionally unavailable, you might spend decades pursuing unavailable partners—unconsciously trying to finally win the love that was withheld. If you could just get this person to choose you, maybe the original wound would heal.

It never works. You can't heal parent wounds through partners. But the unconscious keeps trying.

### High Arousal Feels Like Connection

Anxiety and attraction are physiologically similar—increased heart rate, heightened attention, emotional intensity.

When someone makes you anxious (will they text back? do they like me? what do they mean?), your body is aroused. You can easily misread this arousal as attraction.

Calm, secure love doesn't produce this arousal. So it feels flat by comparison—even though it's actually healthier.

### Worthiness Beliefs

If deep down you believe you're not worthy of love, consistent love will feel wrong. Something must be off. You'll sabotage, pick fights, or simply lose interest.

You'll be drawn to people whose ambivalent treatment confirms your beliefs. The person who adores you feels suspicious. The person who's unsure feels right.

## Recognizing Your Pattern

Start paying attention:

**Who do you actually pursue?** Not who you match with or go on dates with. Who do you develop feelings for? Who occupies your thoughts?

**Who feels boring?** When someone is clearly interested, consistent, available—how do you respond? Interest or dismissal?

**What triggers excitement?** Is it the person themselves, or the uncertainty? Would you still be this interested if they were fully committed?

**What's the common thread?** Look at your relationship history. What do these people have in common? Not superficially—psychologically.

The pattern is usually there if you're willing to see it.

## The Rerouting

Changing this requires working on multiple levels:

### 1. Understand the Origin

Where did you learn that love feels like this? What was your parents' relationship like? How was love expressed—or withheld—in your early life?

You're not blaming anyone. You're mapping the programming so you can rewrite it.

### 2. Name the Pattern

Make it explicit: "I'm attracted to unavailable people because their unavailability triggers something familiar."

Naming breaks the trance. You can't change a pattern you won't see.

### 3. Rewire the Association

This is body-level work. When someone healthy shows up and feels "boring," notice what's happening in your body. That flatness isn't lack of connection—it might be the absence of anxiety.

Start associating different sensations with love. Calm isn't boring. Consistency isn't weak. Availability isn't desperate.

### 4. Choose Differently (Even When It Feels Wrong)

Sometimes you have to override your instincts. Stay with the "boring" person longer. Give consistent, available people a real chance.

This feels wrong at first. Your nervous system protests. But over time, your brain rewires. What felt flat starts to feel safe. What felt safe starts to feel attractive.

### 5. Heal the Original Wound

The pull toward unhealthy dynamics often weakens when you address what's underneath. Therapy. Inner child work. Processing the grief of what you didn't get.

When the original need is met (through internal work, not through finally winning an unavailable person), the compulsion fades.

## The Hard Truth

Here's what no one wants to hear: you might not currently be capable of the relationship you say you want.

If your system is wired for chaos, health will repel you. If your worthiness wound is deep, being adored will feel unbearable. If your attachment style is anxious or avoidant, secure love will trigger you.

This isn't a judgment. It's just what's true.

The good news: these things change. Attachment styles shift. Wounds heal. What once felt impossible becomes possible.

But only if you do the work. You can't think your way into new patterns. You have to feel your way, choosing differently, tolerating the discomfort, letting your nervous system learn new associations.

## What You're Really Looking For

Underneath the pursuit of unavailable people is usually a search for something real:

- The anxious chaser wants to finally feel chosen, worthy, enough
- The one drawn to chaos wants to feel fully alive
- The one pursuing unavailability wants to protect themselves from true vulnerability

None of these needs are wrong. But you're trying to meet them in ways that don't work.

You can feel worthy without earning it through pursuit. You can feel alive through connection, not drama. You can protect yourself through discernment, not avoidance.

The healthy relationship won't give you the adrenaline hit. It will give you something else—peace, partnership, growth. But you have to be able to receive it.

## Going Forward

Notice the gap between what you say you want and what you actually choose. Get curious about it without judgment.

Ask yourself: if I got exactly what I say I want, could I receive it? Or would I sabotage, run, or lose interest?

That answer tells you where the work is.

The good news: you're not broken. You learned patterns that made sense at one point. Now you're learning new ones.

It takes time. It's uncomfortable. But eventually, what you want and what you chase can align. And that's when real love becomes possible.
