You had an experience. Maybe it was beautiful. Maybe it was terrifying. Maybe both.

Now what?

This is where most people get stuck. The ceremony ends, normal life resumes, and that profound experience slowly fades into a strange memory that doesn't quite fit anywhere.

This guide covers the full arc: preparation, navigation, and integration. Because what you do before and after matters as much as the experience itself.

## Why integration matters

Psychedelic experiences can crack you open. But being cracked open isn't the same as being transformed.

Without integration:
- Insights fade within weeks
- Old patterns reassert themselves
- The experience becomes just another story
- You might even be worse off—destabilized without new ground

With integration:
- Insights become embodied understanding
- New patterns have space to take root
- The experience becomes a turning point
- Real, lasting change becomes possible

Integration is the bridge between having an experience and becoming someone new.

## Before: Preparation

What you bring to the experience shapes what you receive from it.

### Physical preparation

**2-4 weeks before:**
- Clean up your diet. Reduce processed foods, alcohol, caffeine
- Prioritize sleep. Your nervous system needs to be resourced
- Move your body. Physical stagnation creates mental stagnation
- Consider the traditional restrictions (dieta) if working with plant medicines

**The day before:**
- Eat lightly
- Avoid screens and stimulation in the evening
- Sleep well
- Fast according to guidance (usually 4-6 hours before)

**Why this matters:** A depleted body can't support the nervous system demands of deep psychedelic work. Physical preparation is respect for the process.

### Mental preparation

**Set your intention:**
- Not a shopping list of what you want to get
- A genuine question or opening
- Examples: "Show me what I need to see." "Help me understand my relationship with [anger/fear/my mother]." "I'm ready to let go of what no longer serves."

**Examine your expectations:**
- Are you expecting bliss? Prepare for difficult terrain too
- Are you expecting answers? Sometimes you get more questions
- Are you expecting to be fixed? This is a partnership, not a repair shop

**Clear what you can:**
- Have difficult conversations before, not after
- Tie up loose ends that might distract
- Make peace with what you can't control

### Practical preparation

**Environment:**
- Safe, comfortable, private space
- Temperature control (you might run hot or cold)
- Comfortable places to sit, lie down, move
- Access to nature if possible
- Bathroom nearby

**Support:**
- Experienced sitter or guide (ideally)
- Someone who knows what you're doing (safety)
- Post-experience support lined up

**Tools:**
- Blankets, pillows
- Eyemask
- Playlist prepared (or silence planned)
- Water accessible
- Tissues (tears are common)
- Journal nearby for after

### Psychological readiness

**Check your stability:**
- Are you in crisis? This isn't the time
- Do you have enough ground to work from?
- Is your life stable enough to handle destabilization?

**Know your why:**
- Curiosity is valid
- Healing intention is valid
- Escape is a red flag
- "Fixing" yourself is a red flag
- Proving something is a red flag

**Accept uncertainty:**
- You don't get to choose what comes up
- The experience you want isn't always the one you need
- Surrender is part of the medicine

## During: Navigation

The experience itself is beyond words. But there are principles that help.

### Surrender

The golden rule: **Let go.**

Resistance creates suffering. When something difficult arises, the instinct is to fight it, flee from it, or control it. This intensifies the difficulty.

Instead:
- Breathe into whatever arises
- Relax your body as much as possible
- Say yes, even to the hard things
- Trust the process, even when it's terrifying

The mantra many find helpful: "Let go. Be here. Trust."

### When difficulty arises

**Breathe.** Slow, deep breaths activate the parasympathetic system.

**Ground.** Feel your body. Feel the floor. Feel your hands.

**Change one thing.** Position, music, environment, eyes open/closed.

**Ask for support.** If you have a sitter, reach for them.

**Remember:** This is temporary. You are safe. The medicine is working.

**Reframe:** Difficult doesn't mean bad. Often the most challenging moments hold the deepest medicine.

### The body is involved

This isn't just a mental experience. Your body is processing too.

- Allow movement that wants to happen
- Don't suppress sounds, tears, shaking
- Pay attention to where you feel things physically
- The body often leads where the mind needs to follow

### Tracking what emerges

You won't remember everything. But certain things will stand out:
- Images or visions
- Emotional releases
- Insights or understandings
- Bodily experiences
- Encounters (with entities, ancestors, parts of self)
- Themes that repeat

These become integration material.

## After: Integration

Integration begins when the acute effects end. It continues for weeks, months, sometimes years.

### The first 24-48 hours

**Protect the space:**
- Don't immediately return to normal life
- Keep screens and stimulation low
- Stay in nature if possible
- Journal while memories are fresh

**What to capture:**
- Key images or moments
- Emotional experiences
- Insights that came through
- Questions that arose
- Body sensations
- Anything that felt significant

**Don't force meaning:**
- Some things won't make sense yet
- Let understanding emerge over time
- Hold it loosely

### The first week

**Physical recovery:**
- Rest more than usual
- Nourish your body
- Move gently
- Sleep as needed

**Emotional tending:**
- You may feel raw, open, sensitive
- Protect yourself from harsh inputs
- Seek gentle connection
- Allow whatever emotions arise

**Meaning-making:**
- Review your notes
- Notice what stays with you
- Talk with trusted others who understand

### The first month

This is where integration becomes work.

**Identify themes:**
What kept coming up? What felt most charged? What wanted attention?

**Name the invitations:**
Most experiences come with implicit invitations: to change something, to let go of something, to embrace something. What was yours?

**Take one concrete action:**
Don't try to change everything at once. Pick one thing from the experience and implement it:
- A daily practice
- A conversation you need to have
- A habit to release
- A relationship to repair
- A boundary to set

**Get support:**
Integration circles, therapy, coaching—someone to help you make sense of it and stay accountable to the changes you're invited to make.

### Ongoing integration

Real integration happens over months and years.

**Regular reflection:**
- Revisit your notes periodically
- Notice what's shifted
- Notice where you're still stuck

**Embodiment practices:**
The insights need to land in your body, not just your mind:
- Meditation
- Breathwork
- Somatic work
- Movement

**Community:**
Integration is easier with others who understand. Find your people.

**Follow-through:**
The experience opened a door. You have to walk through it. Repeatedly. In daily life. In difficult moments. In choices that matter.

## Common integration challenges

### The fade

**What it looks like:** That profound understanding feels increasingly distant. Normal life reasserts itself. Nothing seems different.

**What helps:**
- Expect this. It's normal.
- Regular practice keeps the door open
- Take action quickly, before momentum fades
- Work with an integration guide

### Spiritual bypassing

**What it looks like:** Using the insights to avoid real-world problems. "Everything is one, so my relationship issues don't matter." "I transcended my anger, so I don't need to work on it."

**What helps:**
- Ground in the body
- Address practical issues practically
- Notice if "spiritual" insights are excuses for avoidance
- Work with someone who won't let you bypass

### Destabilization

**What it looks like:** The experience opened more than you could handle. You feel ungrounded, anxious, or disconnected from normal life.

**What helps:**
- Stop all psychedelic use
- Focus on grounding and stabilization
- Reduce stimulation and demands
- Get professional support—specifically someone trauma-informed
- Prioritize sleep, food, routine, nature

### Chasing experiences

**What it looks like:** Wanting another experience instead of integrating this one. The experience itself becomes the goal, not the integration.

**What helps:**
- Sit with what you already have
- Integration before more experiences
- Ask: what am I avoiding by seeking another journey?
- The real work happens in ordinary life

### Comparison

**What it looks like:** "Everyone else has profound experiences. Mine wasn't good enough." Or: "My experience was so amazing, normal life can't compare."

**What helps:**
- Your experience was exactly what you needed
- The profundity is in the integration, not the experience
- Ordinary life IS the practice ground
- Stop comparing

## When to seek support

**Definitely seek help if:**
- Persistent anxiety, depression, or destabilization
- Difficulty functioning in daily life
- Dissociation that doesn't resolve
- Disturbing content you can't process alone
- Relationships suffering
- Suicidal thoughts

**Consider support for:**
- Making sense of complex experiences
- Accountability for changes
- Faster, deeper integration
- Processing difficult material safely

Integration specialists, psychedelic-informed therapists, and experienced practitioners can help. This work is better with support.

## The real work

Here's the truth most people don't want to hear:

The psychedelic experience is the easy part.

Integration—changing your life, releasing old patterns, becoming who you glimpsed—is the hard part. It happens in ordinary moments. In how you respond to your partner. In whether you keep the practice. In choices no one sees.

The medicine shows you the door. You have to walk through it.

Every day. For the rest of your life.

That's what integration really is: the ongoing practice of becoming who you already are.

And that's enough. That's everything.
