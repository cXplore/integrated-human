Relationships end. They end through death, breakups, drifting apart, betrayal, choice.

How you navigate endings shapes who you become and how you relate going forward.

## Why endings are so hard

### Identity disruption
Your identity becomes intertwined with relationships. When it ends, part of your sense of self is lost.

### Loss of future
You lose not just what was, but what was imagined.

### Attachment activation
Ending triggers attachment systems hard. The person you're bonded to is now unavailable.

## Different kinds of endings

- **The gradual fade**: No clear closure
- **The sudden break**: Shock and acute intensity
- **The mutual release**: Still hurts despite agreement
- **The one-sided ending**: Rejection and powerlessness
- **The forced ending**: Death or circumstance, no choice

## The grief process

Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Not linear. You'll cycle through multiple times.

## How to navigate endings

- Don't skip the grief
- Limit contact (usually)
- Manage the narratives (watch for distorted thinking)
- Learn from it
- Take care of basics (sleep, nutrition, movement)
- Accept support
- Create new meaning
- Don't rush the next thing

## Ending well (when you have choice)

If you're ending a relationship:
- Be honest about why
- Be clear, not cruel
- Take responsibility for your part
- Allow their reaction

## Closure

Closure comes from inside, not from them:
- Accepting reality
- Processing emotions
- Making meaning
- Moving forward with intention

## After the ending

It gets better. The intensity decreases. You'll integrate the experience. You'll be wiser.

Endings are not the opposite of love. They're part of love.

Navigate them with care.
