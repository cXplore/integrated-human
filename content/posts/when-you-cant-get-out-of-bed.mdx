Some mornings start slower than others. This is about working with that, not against it.

Instead of fighting heaviness, here's how to gently invite movement—starting with what's already possible.

## What's Actually Happening

When you can't get out of bed, your nervous system has likely shifted into a protective state. This isn't laziness or weakness—it's your body's ancient survival response.

In the face of overwhelming stress, threat, or depletion, the body sometimes chooses conservation over action. It's trying to protect you by shutting down non-essential functions.

Understanding this doesn't fix it, but it might help you stop fighting yourself.

## The Smallest Possible Steps

Don't try to get up. Try these instead:

**While still lying down:**
- Move one finger. Then another.
- Wiggle your toes.
- Take one breath that's slightly deeper than the others.
- Notice something you can see from where you are.
- Notice something you can hear.

That's it. That's enough for now.

## If You Can Sit Up

If sitting up becomes possible:
- Stay sitting. Don't stand yet.
- Put your feet on the floor. Feel the ground.
- Look around the room slowly.
- Name three things you see.

There's no rush to do more.

## When Standing Feels Possible

- Stand next to the bed. Hold onto something if needed.
- Stay there for a moment.
- Feel your feet on the floor.
- You don't have to go anywhere yet.

## What Not to Do

- Don't set ambitious goals for the day
- Don't check your phone for messages that require responses
- Don't think about everything you "should" be doing
- Don't compare this to how you usually function

## What Your Body Might Need

**Water.** Even a few sips. Dehydration makes everything harder.

**Something small to eat.** A cracker. A bite of anything. Your brain needs fuel.

**Warmth or coolness.** Whatever feels right. A blanket. A cool cloth.

**Gentle movement.** Not exercise. Just moving your limbs slowly.

## The Bare Minimum Day

If this is a bare minimum day, here's what counts as success:
- Staying alive
- Drinking some water
- Eating something
- Using the bathroom when needed

Everything else is extra credit.

## When This Keeps Happening

If you regularly can't get out of bed, something needs attention. This could be:
- Depression
- Burnout
- A physical health issue
- Chronic stress that's exceeded your capacity
- Grief
- Trauma responses

You don't have to figure out which one right now. But at some point, when you have a bit more capacity, reaching out for support matters.

## A Note on Shame

You might feel ashamed that you're struggling with something that seems so basic. That shame is understandable but misplaced.

Millions of people have days like this. Your nervous system is responding to something real, even if you can't name it. This doesn't mean you're broken.

## For Right Now

If you read this whole thing, you did something. That's real.

If you can only do one thing today, let it be this: be gentle with yourself. Not as a reward for doing well, but as a baseline for being human.

Tomorrow might be different. Today is today.

You're still here. That matters.
