Biomechanics is how your body moves and handles force. Most people violate basic biomechanical principles constantly—then wonder why they're in pain.

You don't need an engineering degree. You need to understand a few key principles and apply them to daily life.

## The core principles

### Stacking

When bones are stacked properly, muscles don't have to work as hard.

Imagine a stack of blocks. If they're aligned, the stack is stable. If they're crooked, it takes effort to hold them up.

Your body works the same way. When joints are aligned, muscles can relax. When they're not, muscles work overtime.

### Levers and load

Your body is a system of levers. The closer a load is to your center of gravity, the easier it is to manage.

**Example:** A 10-pound weight held close to your chest is easy. The same weight held at arm's length is much harder—even though it weighs the same.

**Implication:** Keep heavy things close. Don't reach.

### Compression vs. shear

Your spine handles compression well—straight vertical force. It handles shear poorly—forces that want to slide vertebrae past each other.

**High shear moments:** Lifting with a rounded back while twisting. This is how discs herniate.

**Low shear:** Lifting with a neutral spine, driving through the legs.

### Use the right muscles

Different muscles are designed for different jobs:
- Big muscles (glutes, quads): Moving and lifting
- Small muscles (rotator cuff, deep core): Stabilizing

If small muscles do big jobs, they fatigue and fail. If big muscles aren't used, small muscles compensate and get injured.

## Practical applications

### Lifting

This is where most injuries happen.

**Good lifting:**
1. Get close to the object
2. Hinge at the hips (not the back)
3. Keep a neutral spine (natural curves maintained)
4. Drive through your legs and glutes
5. Keep the load close as you stand
6. If you need to turn, move your feet—don't twist under load

**Bad lifting:**
- Rounding the back
- Reaching for objects
- Twisting while lifting
- Using the back instead of legs/glutes
- Jerky movements

### Sitting

Sitting isn't evil, but sustained sitting is hard on the body.

**Better sitting:**
- Support the natural curve of your lower back
- Feet flat on floor (or supported)
- Screen at eye level (avoid looking down)
- Shoulders relaxed, not hunched
- Change positions frequently
- Take movement breaks

**What helps:**
- Varied sitting positions
- Standing desk (alternating)
- Movement every 30-60 minutes
- Adequate chair support

### Standing

Standing all day isn't better than sitting all day. Varied positions are best.

**Standing well:**
- Weight distributed between feet
- Slight knee bend (not locked)
- Pelvis neutral (not tipped far forward or back)
- Shoulders relaxed, not pulled back artificially
- Head balanced on spine, not jutting forward

**Avoid:**
- Locking knees
- Shifting all weight to one leg (occasionally fine, not habitually)
- Artificial "military" posture

### Walking

Walking is our primary movement—but most people walk poorly.

**Efficient walking:**
- Push off with the back foot (glute engagement)
- Let arms swing naturally (opposite arm to leg)
- Land with relative foot underneath you
- Head balanced, eyes forward
- Relaxed, not rigid

**Common problems:**
- No push-off (shuffling)
- Over-striding (landing ahead of body)
- Minimal arm swing
- Looking down

### Carrying

One-sided carrying (bags, briefcases) creates asymmetrical load.

**Better carrying:**
- Distribute weight evenly when possible (backpack)
- Switch sides regularly
- Keep load close to body
- Be aware of compensation patterns

### Using screens

Screen use dominates modern life and creates specific biomechanical problems.

**Phone:**
- Bring phone to face (don't drop head to phone)
- Use voice input when possible
- Limit duration
- Stretch the neck regularly

**Computer:**
- Screen at eye level
- External keyboard/mouse (not just laptop)
- Arms supported
- Regular breaks

## Breathing mechanics

Breathing is biomechanics too.

**Good breathing mechanics:**
- Diaphragm descends on inhale (belly expands)
- Ribcage expands laterally
- Shoulders don't rise significantly
- Exhale is passive (unless exercising hard)

**Common dysfunction:**
- Chest breathing (shoulders rise, belly doesn't expand)
- Reverse breathing (belly in on inhale)
- Breath holding
- Shallow, rapid breathing

Breathing dysfunction affects everything—neck tension, core stability, nervous system state.

## Movement variety

The body isn't designed for any single position. It's designed for variety.

**The problem:** Modern life is repetitive—same positions, same movements, same patterns.

**The solution:** Vary positions throughout the day. Move in different ways. Use your body differently than you usually do.

Your best posture is your next posture. Movement is the solution to almost every postural problem.

## Pain as information

When biomechanics are violated, pain often results—though not always immediately.

**Pain signals:**
- Something is wrong (don't ignore)
- But not always where the pain is (referred pain is common)
- May be cumulative (years of bad patterns)
- Needs investigation, not just suppression

If you're in chronic pain, look at your daily biomechanics. The cause is often in how you use your body, not in a pathology.

## Building awareness

### Check in regularly

Throughout the day, notice: How am I positioned? Where is tension? What patterns am I in?

### Feel, don't force

Better movement comes from awareness, not from forcing "correct" positions. Feel what's happening, then make small adjustments.

### Incremental change

You can't fix decades of patterns overnight. Make small improvements. Let them become natural before adding more.

*Good biomechanics isn't about perfect posture. It's about moving in ways that don't hurt you—and that let your body work as designed.*
