You know exercise is good for mental health. Everyone knows.

But knowing doesn't equal doing, and vague advice doesn't equal actionable guidance.

Here's what the research actually shows, and how to apply it.

## The effects are real and large

For depression:
- Meta-analyses show exercise as effective as medication for mild-moderate depression
- Effects are dose-dependent (more tends to be better, up to a point)
- Benefits persist after stopping (unlike medication)
- Works through multiple mechanisms

For anxiety:
- Immediate anxiolytic effect (acute exercise reduces anxiety for hours)
- Long-term practice reduces baseline anxiety
- Works for generalized anxiety, panic, and social anxiety
- Especially effective when combined with exposure for phobias

For cognitive function:
- Improves memory, especially in aging
- Enhances executive function
- Protects against cognitive decline
- Acutely improves focus and creativity

## The mechanisms

### BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
Exercise increases BDNF, which promotes neuroplasticity and new neuron growth. This is like fertilizer for your brain.

### Neurotransmitter regulation
Exercise acutely increases serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Chronically, it improves neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity.

### Inflammation reduction
Depression and anxiety are linked to inflammation. Exercise is anti-inflammatory.

### HPA axis regulation
Exercise helps normalize the stress response system that's often dysregulated in anxiety and depression.

### Sleep improvement
Better sleep = better mental health. Exercise improves sleep quality.

### Self-efficacy
Actually doing hard things builds belief in your ability to do hard things. This generalizes.

## What kind of exercise?

### Both cardio and strength matter

**Cardio** seems to have stronger acute mood benefits and better evidence for depression specifically.

**Strength training** shows significant effects on anxiety, builds confidence, and has unique benefits for depression as well.

**Best approach**: Do both. 2-3 resistance sessions + 2-3 cardio sessions per week.

### Intensity matters

**For depression**: Moderate to vigorous intensity shows strongest effects. You need to actually challenge yourself.

**For anxiety**: Both work. High intensity may be better for reducing sensitivity to physical arousal (the symptoms of anxiety feel less threatening when you're used to elevated heart rate).

**For acute stress relief**: High intensity tends to work better. You want to discharge the activation.

### Duration matters less than you think

30-45 minutes is enough. Some studies show benefit from even 10-15 minutes.

Consistency matters more than duration.

## The minimum effective dose

If you're doing nothing:
- Start with 10-15 minute walks daily
- Add one strength session per week
- Build gradually

If you want mental health benefits:
- 150 minutes moderate cardio per week (or 75 vigorous)
- 2 resistance training sessions per week
- Some outdoor activity

If you're optimizing:
- 3-4 strength sessions
- 2-3 cardio sessions (mix intensities)
- Daily walking
- Some high-intensity work

## When exercise makes it worse

### Overtraining
Too much exercise with inadequate recovery increases cortisol, disrupts sleep, and can worsen mood. More isn't always better.

### Exercise addiction
Using exercise to avoid emotions, punish yourself, or control anxiety compulsively. The exercise becomes part of the problem.

### Wrong timing
High intensity late at night disrupts sleep. Exhausting yourself when you need energy for other things.

### Ignoring other needs
Exercise isn't a substitute for sleep, nutrition, connection, or addressing the actual sources of distress.

## The practical application

### When depressed
Starting is hardest when you most need it. Strategies:
- Commit to just 5 minutes. Usually you'll keep going.
- Social accountability (meet someone)
- Schedule it like an appointment
- Lower the bar: walking counts
- Outdoor exercise if possible

### When anxious
Use exercise to discharge activation:
- High intensity intervals
- Something that requires focus (climbing, sports)
- Walking or running in nature
- Strength training with presence

### For cognitive enhancement
- Exercise before creative or demanding work
- Morning exercise for all-day benefits
- Consistency matters more than intensity for brain benefits

## The deeper integration

Exercise is most powerful when it's not punishment.

If you exercise from self-hatred, the psychological benefits diminish. If you exercise from self-care, they amplify.

The motivation matters. The story you tell about why you're doing it matters.

You're not exercising to fix something broken. You're exercising because your body evolved to move, and depriving it of movement creates problems.

Movement isn't medicine for the broken. It's a basic requirement for being human.
