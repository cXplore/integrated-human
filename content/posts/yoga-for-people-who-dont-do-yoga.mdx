Most people avoid yoga because it looks like something for flexible people who already have their life together.

It's not.

Yoga is for stiff people. For anxious people. For people who live in their heads and have forgotten they have a body.

If that's you, this is your starting point.

## Why yoga matters

Let's skip the spiritual sales pitch and get practical.

**Physical benefits:**
- Unfucks your posture from sitting all day
- Prevents injuries from lifting, sports, life
- Builds functional strength you can actually use
- Improves recovery between training sessions
- Keeps you mobile as you age

**Mental benefits:**
- Teaches nervous system regulation (this is huge)
- Builds tolerance for discomfort
- Trains focus and presence
- Reduces baseline anxiety
- Better sleep

**The hidden benefit:**
Yoga teaches you to stay calm while uncomfortable.

That skill transfers to everything — hard conversations, stress at work, staying grounded when emotions run high.

## The bare minimum to start

You don't need:
- Expensive classes
- Special clothes
- Flexibility
- An hour of free time
- To understand Sanskrit

You need:
- A floor
- 10-15 minutes
- Willingness to feel awkward

## Five poses that actually matter

These aren't exotic. They're fundamental. Master these and you've got 80% of what you need.

### 1. Downward Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)

The foundation pose. Stretches hamstrings, calves, shoulders, and spine all at once.

**How to do it:**
- Start on hands and knees
- Hands shoulder-width apart, fingers spread
- Push hips up and back
- Straighten legs as much as you can (bent knees are fine)
- Let your head hang, neck relaxed
- Push the floor away with your hands

**Common mistakes:**
- Forcing straight legs when your hamstrings aren't ready
- Rounding the spine instead of lengthening it
- Holding breath

Hold for 5-10 breaths. Return often.

### 2. Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I)

Builds leg strength, opens hip flexors, teaches stability.

**How to do it:**
- Step one foot forward into a lunge
- Back foot angled about 45 degrees
- Square your hips forward as much as possible
- Bend front knee to 90 degrees (knee over ankle)
- Arms reach overhead, shoulders down

**Where you'll feel it:**
- Back leg hip flexor (the tight one from sitting)
- Front leg quad
- Core working to stabilize

Hold 5-8 breaths each side.

### 3. Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)

The hip opener. Most people are horrifyingly tight here.

**How to do it:**
- From downward dog, bring one knee forward behind your wrist
- Angle your shin (doesn't need to be parallel to front of mat)
- Extend back leg straight behind you
- Square your hips as much as possible
- Either stay upright or fold forward over front leg

**Warning:** This will be intense if your hips are tight. That's the point. Breathe through it.

Hold 1-2 minutes each side. This one needs time.

### 4. Cobra or Upward Dog (Bhujangasana / Urdhva Mukha Svanasana)

Counteracts the forward hunch of modern life.

**How to do it (Cobra — the gentler version):**
- Lie face down, hands under shoulders
- Press into hands, lift chest
- Keep hips on the ground
- Elbows can stay bent
- Shoulders away from ears
- Look slightly up or forward

**The difference:**
- Cobra = hips stay down, less intense
- Upward dog = hips lift, legs off ground, deeper backbend

Start with cobra. Work up.

### 5. Child's Pose (Balasana)

The reset button. Come here whenever you need to.

**How to do it:**
- Knees wide, big toes touching
- Sit hips back toward heels
- Arms extended forward or alongside body
- Forehead rests on the floor
- Breathe into your lower back

This is rest, not a stretch. Use it between poses, use it when things get intense, use it when you're done.

## The breath matters more than the pose

Here's what most people miss:

The pose is just a container. The breath is the practice.

**Basic breathing protocol:**
- Inhale through the nose, 4 counts
- Exhale through the nose, 4-6 counts
- Exhale should be equal or longer than inhale
- Never hold breath during poses

**Why it matters:**
- Long exhales activate parasympathetic nervous system
- You're literally training your body that discomfort ≠ danger
- This is the nervous system regulation everyone talks about

If you can't breathe smoothly in a pose, you've gone too deep. Back off until you can.

## A 15-minute routine you can actually do

Do this 3x per week minimum. Every day is better.

1. **Child's Pose** — 1 minute (arrive, settle)
2. **Cat-Cow** — 10 rounds (warm up spine)
3. **Downward Dog** — 5 breaths
4. **Warrior I Right** — 5 breaths
5. **Warrior I Left** — 5 breaths
6. **Downward Dog** — 5 breaths
7. **Pigeon Right** — 1-2 minutes
8. **Pigeon Left** — 1-2 minutes
9. **Cobra** — 5 breaths, 2 rounds
10. **Child's Pose** — 1 minute (close)

That's it. Under 15 minutes. No excuses.

## Common objections (and why they're wrong)

**"I'm not flexible enough for yoga."**
That's like saying you're too dirty to shower. Yoga is how you get flexible.

**"It's too slow / boring."**
Your nervous system is probably fried from constant stimulation. The boredom is part of the medicine.

**"It's not a real workout."**
Try holding warrior II for two minutes and tell me that. But also — not everything needs to destroy you. Recovery is training too.

**"It's too spiritual / weird."**
Then skip the chanting and Sanskrit. Do the poses, breathe, leave. The physical benefits don't require belief.

**"I don't have time."**
15 minutes. You have time for your phone, you have time for this.

## How to progress

Once the basic routine feels manageable:

1. **Add time** — Work up to 30-45 minutes
2. **Add poses** — Warrior II, Triangle, Forward Fold, Twists
3. **Add challenge** — Hold poses longer, go deeper
4. **Add consistency** — Daily practice beats occasional long sessions
5. **Add heat** — Try a heated class once you have the basics

## The real point

Yoga isn't about touching your toes.

It's about learning to be present in your body, even when it's uncomfortable.

It's about training your nervous system to stay calm under stress.

It's about building a foundation that lets everything else — training, working, creating, loving — function better.

You don't have to become a yogi.

You just have to show up, breathe, and let your body open at its own pace.

Start with 15 minutes.

See what happens.
