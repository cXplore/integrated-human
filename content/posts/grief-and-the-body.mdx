Grief is not just an emotion.

It's a full-body experience. Your chest aches. Your throat tightens. Your limbs feel heavy. Your heart—the actual organ—hurts.

This isn't metaphor. Grief lives in the body. And to fully grieve, you have to work with the body.

## How grief shows up physically

The body's response to grief is profound:

**Cardiovascular:**
- Literally heartache—grief increases heart attack risk
- "Broken heart syndrome" (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) is a real medical condition
- Blood pressure changes
- Racing heart or slow heart

**Immune system:**
- Increased inflammation
- Higher cortisol levels
- More susceptibility to illness
- Slower wound healing

**Musculoskeletal:**
- Chest tightness
- Throat constriction
- Shoulder and neck tension
- Heaviness in the limbs
- Whole-body fatigue

**Neurological:**
- Brain fog, difficulty concentrating
- Memory problems
- Disrupted sleep
- Altered sense of time

**Digestive:**
- Appetite changes (too much or too little)
- Nausea
- Stomach upset
- Altered taste

**Other:**
- Sighing (the body trying to reset)
- Crying (emotional and physical release)
- Feeling cold or hot
- Exhaustion beyond normal tiredness

This isn't weakness. It's your body responding to loss. Grief is metabolically, immunologically, neurologically real.

## The body holds grief

Here's what makes grief tricky:

The mind might be ready to move forward. The body isn't.

You can think about the loss calmly. But your chest still aches. You can "understand" your grief intellectually. But your throat still tightens when you try to speak about it.

Grief gets stored in the body. And it stays there until it's released.

**Where grief commonly lodges:**

**Chest:** The heartache. The crushing weight. Difficulty taking full breaths.

**Throat:** The lump. Words stuck. Unable to express.

**Belly:** The pit in your stomach. Nausea. Emptiness.

**Jaw:** Clenched, holding back screams or cries.

**Shoulders:** Carrying the weight. Hunched protection.

**Eyes:** Burning. Heavy. Empty of tears or full of them.

Notice where you hold yours. That's where the work needs to happen.

## Why body-based grief work matters

You can't think your way through grief. It's not a cognitive process.

Grief is emotion moving through the body. Emotion = energy in motion. If it doesn't move, it stagnates.

Stuck grief:
- Stays in the body as chronic tension
- Converts to physical symptoms
- Blocks further processing
- Keeps you frozen in one stage

Moving grief through the body:
- Releases what's been held
- Completes the grief cycle
- Creates genuine resolution
- Allows integration

The mind processes through narrative and understanding.
The body processes through sensation and movement.

You need both.

## Somatic practices for grief

### 1. Let yourself cry

Crying is the body's primary grief-release mechanism.

Don't:
- Suppress tears to "be strong"
- Stop crying before it's done
- Apologize for crying

Do:
- Let the tears come
- Continue until they naturally stop
- Notice how your body feels afterward (usually lighter)

If you can't cry:
- That's okay too. Grief isn't always tears.
- Other forms of release are equally valid.
- It may come later, when you're safer.

### 2. Sound and voice

Grief wants to be voiced. The wail, the keen, the moan—these are ancient human grief expressions.

**Practice:**
- Find a private space
- Let sound come—sighs, moans, wails
- Don't try to form words
- Let the sound move the grief

If this feels too vulnerable:
- Hum into your chest
- Sing sad songs
- Speak the name of who/what you lost
- Read poems or prayers aloud

Sound vibrates the body and releases what's stuck.

### 3. Breath

Grief constricts breathing. We hold our breath, breathe shallowly, can't get a full inhale.

**Grief breath practice:**
- Place one hand on chest, one on belly
- Breathe into the belly first, then chest
- Let the exhale be a sigh—audible release
- Allow tears if they come
- Continue for 5-10 minutes

**Extended sighing:**
- Inhale normally
- Exhale as a long, loud sigh
- Let the whole body release on the out-breath
- Repeat until something shifts

The sigh is the body's natural reset. Use it consciously.

### 4. Movement

Grief creates physical stagnation. Movement counters this.

**Gentle movement:**
- Slow walking
- Swaying
- Rocking (very primal, very soothing)
- Swimming
- Yoga (slow, restorative)

**Vigorous movement:**
- Sometimes grief needs to rage
- Hit a punching bag
- Stomp and pound
- Run hard
- Shake vigorously

**Free movement:**
- Put on music
- Let your body move however it wants
- Don't choreograph, just feel
- Let the grief express through motion

### 5. Touch and holding

Grief creates a longing for contact. We're mammals; we're meant to be held.

**Self-holding:**
- Wrap yourself in a heavy blanket
- Hug yourself, really hold yourself
- Place a hand on your heart
- Place a hand where you feel the grief

**From others:**
- Ask for hugs, if available
- Ask to be held without talking
- Massage or bodywork
- Human touch is a profound grief comfort

**Objects:**
- Hold something that belonged to the person
- Hug a pillow or stuffed animal
- Feel the weight and presence of something soft

### 6. Body scanning for grief

Where is the grief living right now?

**Practice:**
- Close your eyes
- Scan slowly from head to toe
- Notice where you find tension, heaviness, pain
- Pause at those places
- Breathe into them
- Don't try to release, just notice and be with

This builds awareness of your grief's physical location, which is the first step to releasing it.

### 7. Shaking and tremoring

Animals in the wild discharge trauma through shaking. We suppress this reflex. Grief benefits from reclaiming it.

**Practice:**
- Stand with soft knees
- Start bouncing gently
- Let the bounce become a shake
- Let arms and head join
- Shake for 2-5 minutes
- Then stand still and feel the settling

This releases survival energy and helps process grief at the body level.

## When grief is stuck in the body

Sometimes grief won't move on its own. Signs it's stuck:

- Chronic physical symptoms that started after the loss
- Inability to cry or feel
- Numbness that persists for months
- Body tension that won't release
- Physical pain with no medical explanation

**What helps:**

**Somatic therapy:**
Somatic Experiencing, Hakomi, sensorimotor psychotherapy—body-based modalities that help release stored grief.

**Bodywork:**
Massage, craniosacral work, myofascial release. The body can release what it's holding through skilled touch.

**EMDR:**
Originally for trauma, also effective for complicated grief. Works with the body's processing system.

**Movement practices:**
Authentic movement, dance therapy, body-based yoga. Structured support for embodied expression.

Professional support is not weakness. Grief is serious physiological work.

## The integration of body grief

Grief doesn't fully process until it moves through the body.

You can talk about your loss for years. But if the body is still clenched, still holding, still guarding—you're not done.

**Signs the body is integrating:**

- Breathing comes easier
- Chest loosens
- Muscle tension decreases
- Sleep improves
- Energy returns (gradually)
- You can think about the loss without your body seizing

This doesn't mean no more pain. But the pain flows rather than stagnates. It comes in waves, moves through, and releases.

That's embodied grief: not gone, but moving.

## Caring for the grieving body

Your body is doing hard work. Support it:

**Rest:**
Grief is exhausting. Sleep more than usual. Rest when you can.

**Nourishment:**
Eat even when you don't feel like it. Simple, nourishing foods.

**Hydration:**
Crying dehydrates. Drink water.

**Movement:**
Gentle, daily. Even a short walk.

**Warmth:**
Grief often creates coldness. Warm baths, blankets, tea.

**Nature:**
Being outside helps regulate the nervous system.

**Less stimulation:**
Reduce demands. Your system is processing. Don't add more.

Be patient. Be gentle. Your body is doing something difficult. It deserves care.

## The body's wisdom

Your body knows how to grieve.

Humans have been grieving since we became human. The body has mechanisms for this—crying, sighing, shaking, calling out.

We suppress these mechanisms because culture tells us to. Crying is weak. Wailing is dramatic. Shaking is weird.

But the body knows. When you give it permission, it will do what it needs to do.

Trust it. Follow it. Let it lead you through the grief.

Your mind will make meaning of the loss. But your body will process it.

Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient alone.

Give grief a body. Let your body grieve.

That's how loss moves through you.

That's how you become someone who can carry it.

That's the work.
