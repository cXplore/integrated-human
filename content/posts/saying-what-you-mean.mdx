"Fine." (Not fine.)

"I don't care, whatever you want." (Strong preference, but not saying.)

"It would be nice if someone did the dishes." (I want YOU to do the dishes.)

Indirect communication seems polite. It often creates confusion, resentment, and relationship damage.

## Why we communicate indirectly

- We fear the response
- We were taught to be "nice"
- We're testing if they'll anticipate our needs
- It's habitual from upbringing

## The cost of indirectness

- Confusion (hints get missed)
- Resentment (you don't get what you need)
- Inefficiency (requires interpretation)
- Mistrust (people doubt what you say)

## What direct communication looks like

### Clear requests
**Indirect:** "The kitchen is a mess."
**Direct:** "Would you clean the kitchen before dinner?"

### Honest statements
**Indirect:** "I'm fine." (With edge in voice.)
**Direct:** "I'm upset about earlier. Can we talk about it?"

### Boundary setting
**Indirect:** Avoiding the person, being cold.
**Direct:** "I'm not comfortable when you comment on my eating. Please stop."

## How to be direct without being harsh

- Use "I" statements
- Be specific, not global
- Own your preferences
- Make requests, not demands
- Acknowledge their perspective
- Mind your tone

## The practice

Start small:
- State a preference you'd usually suppress
- Make a request directly
- Give an honest answer

Direct communication is a form of respect. It respects the other person, yourself, and the relationship.

Say what you mean. With kindness, with care, but clearly.
