You know when someone is really listening to you. You can feel it.

You also know when they're just waiting for their turn to talk. You can feel that too.

Real listening is rare. And it's one of the most powerful things you can offer another person.

## What most "listening" actually is

**Waiting to respond**: Planning what you'll say while they talk. You're physically present, mentally composing.

**Listening for problems to solve**: Waiting to hear something you can fix. You miss everything that's not a problem.

**Listening for something familiar**: "Oh that's like when I..." Turning their experience into a springboard for yours.

**Listening for something to disagree with**: Scanning for flaws in their logic or perspective.

These are all common. None are real listening.

## What real listening is

Real listening is:
- Full attention on the other person
- Receiving, not preparing
- Curious about their experience, not yours
- Open, not filtering through your agenda
- Present in your body, not just your head

When you really listen, you temporarily set aside your own narrative. You enter their world. You try to understand what it's like to be them.

## How to actually listen

### 1. Start with intention

Before the conversation, set an intention: "I'm going to focus on understanding them, not being understood."

### 2. Remove distractions

Phone away. Not on table, in pocket. Screens off.

### 3. Be in your body

Attention anchored in your body helps you stay present. Feel your feet. Feel your breath.

### 4. Let them finish

Don't interrupt. Not even to agree. Wait until they complete their thought.

### 5. Don't plan your response

Instead of formulating what you'll say, stay curious. "What else is true for them?"

### 6. Reflect before adding

When they finish, reflect what you heard before adding anything:
- "It sounds like you're feeling..."
- "What I'm hearing is..."

### 7. Ask expansive questions

Questions that open rather than close:
- "What was that like for you?"
- "Say more about that."
- "What else is there?"

### 8. Resist the fix

Unless they ask for advice, don't give it. Just being understood is often what they needed.

## The gift of being heard

When someone truly listens to you:
- You feel seen
- You feel valued
- You think more clearly
- You often discover what you actually think
- You feel connected

This is a profound gift. And you can give it.

## The practice

Pick one conversation today. Just one.

Set the intention: "I'm going to really listen."

Remove distractions. Stay in your body. Let them finish. Reflect before responding.

Notice what happens. Notice what's different.

This one practice transforms relationships more than almost anything else.
