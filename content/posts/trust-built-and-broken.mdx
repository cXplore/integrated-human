Without trust, relationships are transactions at best, minefields at worst.

With trust, vulnerability becomes possible. Conflict becomes navigable. Connection deepens.

## What trust actually is

Trust is confidence that:
- You'll do what you say
- You have my interests in mind
- You'll handle my vulnerability with care
- You'll be honest with me
- You'll be consistent

## How trust is built

### Small moments, over time
Trust isn't built through grand gestures. It's built through accumulated small moments:
- You said you'd call, and you called
- You kept what I told you private
- You showed up when you said you would

### The trust equation
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation

Full trust requires all three: credibility, reliability, and intimacy — with low self-interest.

### Vulnerability begets vulnerability
Trust deepens through reciprocal vulnerability. You share something real. They honor it and share something back.

## How trust is broken

### The obvious: Betrayal
Lying. Breaking commitments. Sharing confidences. Infidelity.

### The subtle: Pattern of small failures
Frequently late. Not following through. Repeated white lies. Death by a thousand cuts.

### The in-between: Failures in vulnerable moments
These hit hardest because they occurred when stakes were high.

## After trust is broken

### For the one who broke it
Full acknowledgment. Understand the impact. Take responsibility. Change behavior. Patient accountability.

### For the one whose trust was broken
Honor your feelings. Assess honestly. Decide what you need. Track the pattern over time.

## When trust can be rebuilt

Factors that support rebuilding: Full accountability. Clear understanding of harm. Genuine behavior change over time.

Factors that work against: Minimizing or excuses. Repeated violations. Pressure to "get over it."

## Self-trust

The foundation of trusting others is trusting yourself:
- Trusting you'll honor your own needs
- Trusting you'll leave harmful situations
- Trusting your perceptions

Trust is the infrastructure of relationship. Build it carefully. Repair it honestly. Know when it can't be repaired.
