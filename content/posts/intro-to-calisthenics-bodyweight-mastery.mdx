Your body is a gym.

Calisthenics—from the Greek kalos (beautiful) and sthenos (strength)—is training using your own bodyweight. No equipment required. Just you, gravity, and a surface.

It's been used for millennia. It builds real-world functional strength. And it's accessible to everyone.

## Why calisthenics

### Accessibility

No gym membership. No equipment. Train anywhere—home, park, hotel room. The barrier to entry is zero.

### Functional strength

Calisthenics builds strength that transfers to real life. Moving your body through space. Controlling your own weight. Practical capability.

### Scalability

From complete beginner to advanced athlete, progressions exist for every level. You're never too weak to start. You're never too strong to be challenged.

### Body awareness

Unlike machines that isolate muscles, calisthenics requires whole-body coordination. You develop proprioception, balance, and body control.

### Sustainability

Low injury risk when done properly. Gentle on joints. Can be practiced for a lifetime without the wear of heavy weights.

## The fundamental movements

All calisthenics is built from a few fundamental patterns:

### Push (horizontal)

**Basic:** Wall push-up → Incline push-up → Knee push-up → Full push-up
**Intermediate:** Diamond push-up → Archer push-up → One-arm progression
**Advanced:** Planche progression → One-arm push-up

**Key points:**
- Hands at chest level, not shoulder level
- Full body tight like a plank
- Shoulders down, not shrugged
- Full range of motion

### Push (vertical)

**Basic:** Pike push-up → Feet elevated pike push-up
**Intermediate:** Wall handstand → Headstand push-up
**Advanced:** Handstand push-up → Free-standing handstand push-up

**Key points:**
- Progress slowly (shoulders are vulnerable)
- Build shoulder stability before advanced moves
- Stack joints properly

### Pull (horizontal)

**Basic:** Incline row (under a table or bar) → Horizontal row
**Intermediate:** Tuck front lever row
**Advanced:** Front lever row

**Key points:**
- Initiate with shoulder blades, not arms
- Full range of motion
- Keep body straight

### Pull (vertical)

**Basic:** Dead hang → Flexed arm hang → Negative pull-up
**Intermediate:** Pull-up → Chin-up → L-sit pull-up
**Advanced:** Muscle-up → One-arm pull-up progression

**Key points:**
- Full dead hang at bottom
- Chin over bar at top
- Control the negative
- No kipping for strength (unless training kipping specifically)

### Squat

**Basic:** Assisted squat → Bodyweight squat
**Intermediate:** Bulgarian split squat → Pistol progression
**Advanced:** Pistol squat → Shrimp squat

**Key points:**
- Knees track over toes
- Full depth (as mobility allows)
- Weight through whole foot
- Keep torso upright

### Hinge

**Basic:** Hip hinge drill → Single-leg deadlift (supported)
**Intermediate:** Single-leg deadlift → Nordic curl negative
**Advanced:** Nordic curl → Single-leg Nordic

**Key points:**
- Hip hinge, not back round
- Control the movement
- Feel it in hamstrings and glutes

### Core

**Basic:** Dead bug → Hollow hold → Plank
**Intermediate:** L-sit → Dragon flag progression
**Advanced:** Front lever → Dragon flag → Human flag progression

**Key points:**
- Core training is about resisting movement, not creating it
- Hollow body position is foundational
- Protect the lower back

## Getting started

### Assess where you are

Can you do:
- 10 push-ups with good form?
- 1 pull-up?
- 20 bodyweight squats?
- A 30-second plank?

If not, you're a beginner (no shame in that). If yes, you're intermediate.

### Start with the basics

Even if you can do advanced moves, master the basics first. Form matters more than difficulty. Perfect the push-up before attempting one-arm push-ups.

### Choose a progression level

For each movement pattern, find the version that challenges you for 5-15 reps. Too easy? Progress. Too hard? Regress.

### Sample beginner routine

Three times per week:
- Push: 3x8 at appropriate progression
- Pull: 3x8 at appropriate progression (or 3x negative pull-ups)
- Squat: 3x12 at appropriate progression
- Hinge: 3x10 single-leg deadlifts each side
- Core: 3x20 seconds hollow hold

### Progress gradually

When you can do 3 sets of 12 reps with good form, progress to the next level. Don't rush. Tendon and connective tissue adaptation takes longer than muscle.

## Training principles

### Consistency over intensity

Regular practice beats occasional intense workouts. Three moderate sessions per week beats one killer session.

### Quality over quantity

One perfect rep is worth more than ten sloppy ones. Form first. Always.

### Progressive overload

To get stronger, gradually increase demand. More reps, harder progressions, more sets, less rest—but change one thing at a time.

### Rest and recovery

Muscles grow during rest, not during training. Allow 48 hours between working the same muscle groups. Sleep is essential.

### Patience

Calisthenics strength builds slowly. Expect months to years for significant progress in advanced skills. That's normal.

## Common mistakes

### Skipping progressions

Trying advanced moves before you're ready leads to injury and bad form. Earn each progression.

### Neglecting pull work

Push-ups are easier to start than pull-ups, so people over-emphasize pushing. Balance is essential.

### Ignoring legs

Upper body skills are flashy, but neglecting legs creates imbalance. Include squats and hinges.

### Not deloading

Occasional easy weeks prevent burnout and allow full recovery. Every 4-6 weeks, reduce volume.

### Training through pain

Discomfort during effort is normal. Sharp pain, joint pain, and pain that persists after training is not. Stop and assess.

## Beyond the basics

As you advance, possibilities expand:
- Skill work (handstands, muscle-ups, levers)
- Increasing difficulty (one-arm, one-leg variations)
- Adding complexity (combinations, flows)
- Weighted calisthenics (when bodyweight is easy)
- Movement practices (parkour elements, locomotion)

But don't rush there. Master the fundamentals first. That takes months or years—and the fundamentals are enough for most people.
