"Just feel your feelings."

You've heard this a thousand times. It sounds nice. But when you actually try to do it, you end up:

- Thinking *about* the feeling instead of feeling it
- Getting overwhelmed and shutting down
- Numbing with food, screens, substances
- Spinning in mental loops that go nowhere
- Not even knowing what you're feeling

This isn't weakness. You were never taught how to do this. Most people weren't.

Here's an actual guide.

## Why you learned to avoid emotions

Before technique, understanding.

You avoid emotions because at some point, feeling them wasn't safe. Maybe:

- Your emotions were dismissed ("stop crying," "you're fine")
- Expressing them led to punishment or withdrawal
- You had to manage a parent's emotions instead of your own
- The emotions were genuinely too big for a child to process
- Being "strong" meant not showing vulnerability

So you learned strategies: suppression, intellectualization, distraction, numbing. These worked. They got you through.

But now they're in the way. Emotions that aren't processed don't disappear. They store in your body, influence your behavior, and leak out sideways — as irritability, anxiety, depression, physical tension, or sudden explosions.

## The difference between feeling and thinking about

Most people, when asked to feel something, go into their heads:

*"I'm feeling sad because she left and that triggered my abandonment wound from childhood and I should probably journal about it..."*

That's analysis. It's useful, but it's not feeling.

Feeling happens in the **body**, not the mind.

The shift is: instead of narrating the story of the emotion, you **feel the sensation** of it.

Where is the sadness *in your body*? Chest? Throat? Face?
What does it actually feel like? Heavy? Tight? Hollow?
What happens if you just... stay there?

## The basic practice

This is simple. Not easy, but simple.

### 1. Stop and notice

When you feel something (or suspect you're avoiding something):

Pause. Take a breath. Arrive in the present moment.

### 2. Find it in the body

Ask: *Where do I feel this in my body?*

Common locations:
- Chest (grief, love, heartbreak)
- Throat (unexpressed words, sadness)
- Stomach (anxiety, fear, dread)
- Shoulders/jaw (anger, tension)
- Solar plexus (power, shame)

If you can't locate it, start with what you *do* notice. Maybe just tension. Maybe numbness itself. That's valid data.

### 3. Describe the sensation

Not the emotion. The physical sensation.

- Tight
- Heavy
- Hot
- Pulsing
- Constricted
- Hollow
- Shaky

Describing keeps you anchored in the body and out of story loops.

### 4. Breathe into it

Direct your breath toward that area. Not to change it. Not to make it go away. Just to be with it.

Breathe in. Feel it. Breathe out. Still feel it.

### 5. Allow it to be there

This is the key. Don't try to:
- Fix it
- Understand it
- Make it go away
- Change it into something else

Just let it be. Exactly as it is. For as long as it wants to be there.

### 6. Notice what shifts

Emotions are energy in motion. When you actually allow them, they move. They might:
- Intensify briefly (this is normal)
- Change quality
- Move to a different part of the body
- Release (tears, sighs, shaking)
- Dissolve

Or they might just stay steady. That's fine too. You're not doing it wrong.

## When emotions feel too big

Sometimes you touch an emotion and it threatens to swallow you. Here's how to work with intensity:

### Titration

You don't have to feel everything all at once.

Touch the edge of the emotion. Feel a little. Then pull back. Resource yourself (feel your feet, look around the room, take a breath). Then touch again.

Like dipping into cold water instead of jumping in. You're building capacity.

### Pendulation

Alternate between the uncomfortable sensation and something neutral or pleasant.

Feel the grief in your chest... then notice your feet on the floor. Back to grief... then feel your hands. Grief... then notice something you see in the room.

This teaches your nervous system that you can feel hard things *and* stay regulated.

### Grounding

If you're getting overwhelmed:
- Feel your feet on the ground
- Press your hands together
- Look around and name 5 things you see
- Touch something with texture
- Take slow breaths, emphasizing the exhale

You can always come back to the emotion later. It's not going anywhere.

## Common blockers

### "I don't know what I'm feeling"

Start with body sensations. You don't need a label.

Or use the basics: mad, sad, glad, afraid, ashamed. Often it's one of these underneath the confusion.

### "I feel numb"

Numbness is protective. It's your system saying "this was too much."

Feel the numbness itself. Where is it? What's its quality? Stay with that.

Sometimes gently moving the body helps: shaking, swaying, walking.

### "I start thinking instead of feeling"

Normal. When you notice you've gone into your head, gently come back to the body.

Where was the sensation? What does it feel like now?

The thinking will happen. Just keep returning.

### "I start crying and can't stop"

Let it happen. Crying is release. The "can't stop" fear is usually just fear — in practice, it does stop.

If it feels genuinely unsafe, use the titration and grounding techniques. You can feel some of it and come back later.

### "Nothing happens"

Maybe nothing needs to happen right now. Maybe the emotion isn't ready to move. Maybe you're doing it right and it's just subtle.

Don't force it. This isn't about achieving catharsis. It's about building the capacity to be with what's there.

## Processing vs. venting

There's a difference between **feeling** emotions and **acting them out**.

**Feeling:** sitting with anger, breathing into it, letting it be there, feeling it move
**Venting:** raging at someone, punching walls, sending the angry text

Venting often perpetuates the emotion. You discharge it briefly but you're still hooked. And usually there's a mess to clean up.

Feeling actually completes the emotion. It moves through you instead of exploding outward.

This doesn't mean you never express emotions to others. But expression is different from explosion.

## When to do this

**In the moment:** When an emotion arises, pause and feel it before reacting. Even 10 seconds of feeling changes your response.

**After an activation:** Something triggered you. Later, sit with what came up. Feel what you didn't have space to feel in the moment.

**In dedicated practice:** Set aside 10-20 minutes to sit with whatever's present. Let emotions arise without agenda.

**In therapy/bodywork:** Work with a trained person who can support you in feeling deeper material.

## What changes over time

As you practice:

- You notice emotions sooner (before they build up)
- You can be with more intensity without getting overwhelmed
- Old stored emotions start to release
- You become less reactive (because emotions complete instead of accumulating)
- You feel more alive (numbness was blocking everything, not just pain)
- Physical tension decreases
- Relationships improve (you're not projecting unfelt emotions onto others)

This isn't quick. It's a lifelong practice. But it's one of the most fundamental skills for psychological health.

## The meta-skill

Here's what this is really teaching you:

**The capacity to be with discomfort without escaping.**

This skill transfers everywhere:
- Difficult conversations
- Uncertainty
- Physical challenge
- Creative blocks
- Life transitions

When you can feel your emotions, you can handle almost anything. Because nothing is actually unbearable — it's the *avoidance* that creates suffering.

The emotion itself? It's just energy passing through.

Let it pass.
