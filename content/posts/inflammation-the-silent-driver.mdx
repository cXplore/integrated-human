Heart disease. Diabetes. Cancer. Alzheimer's. Autoimmune conditions. Depression.

Different diseases. Different organs. One common thread: chronic inflammation.

Understanding inflammation — what causes it, what maintains it, what reduces it — is understanding a root cause of most modern disease.

## Acute vs. chronic inflammation

**Acute inflammation** is healthy. You cut your finger. The area gets red, warm, swollen. Immune cells rush in. Healing happens. Inflammation resolves.

This is supposed to happen.

**Chronic inflammation** is the problem. It's low-grade, persistent, systemic. You don't feel it acutely. There's no obvious redness or swelling. But your immune system stays mildly activated, constantly, for months and years.

This slow burn damages tissues, accelerates aging, and creates conditions for disease.

## How to know if you're inflamed

### Lab markers

- **hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)**: A general inflammation marker. Under 1.0 mg/L is optimal. Over 3.0 is high risk.
- **Homocysteine**: Should be under 10.
- **Ferritin**: Can indicate inflammation when elevated without iron deficiency.
- **Fasting insulin**: Elevated levels correlate with inflammation.
- **ESR**: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Nonspecific marker.

### Symptoms

No single symptom means inflammation, but chronic inflammation often shows as:
- Persistent fatigue
- Aches and pains without injury
- Brain fog
- Mood problems (depression, anxiety)
- Digestive issues
- Skin problems
- Weight gain, especially abdominal
- Frequent illness

## The modern inflammation epidemic

Our ancestors dealt with acute inflammation: infections, injuries, occasional famine. Their inflammation resolved.

Modern life creates chronic inflammation:

**Diet:** Seed oils, refined sugar, processed foods, insufficient omega-3s, insufficient fiber.

**Gut:** Disrupted microbiome, intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"), food sensitivities.

**Stress:** Chronic psychological stress raises inflammatory markers.

**Sleep:** Sleep deprivation dramatically increases inflammation.

**Toxins:** Air pollution, pesticides, plastics, heavy metals.

**Sedentary lifestyle:** Exercise is anti-inflammatory. Sitting is pro-inflammatory.

**Obesity:** Fat tissue, especially visceral fat, is an active inflammatory organ.

**Social isolation:** Loneliness raises inflammatory markers.

Each factor contributes. Together, they create a background inflammation level our ancestors never experienced.

## Anti-inflammatory strategies

### Diet (most powerful lever)

**Reduce:**
- Seed/vegetable oils (soybean, corn, canola, sunflower): High in omega-6, which promotes inflammation when out of balance
- Sugar and refined carbs: Spike insulin, promote inflammation
- Processed foods: Combine the above plus additives
- Alcohol: Inflames gut and liver
- Trans fats: Universally inflammatory

**Increase:**
- Omega-3 fatty acids: Fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel), or supplement
- Polyphenols: Colorful vegetables and fruits, especially berries, leafy greens
- Fiber: Feeds beneficial gut bacteria, produces anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids
- Olive oil: Anti-inflammatory monounsaturated fat
- Turmeric/curcumin: Potent anti-inflammatory compound
- Ginger: Anti-inflammatory effects
- Green tea: Contains anti-inflammatory catechins
- Dark chocolate: Polyphenol-rich (high cacao)

**Patterns that work:**
- Mediterranean diet
- Low-glycemic eating
- Whole foods, minimally processed

### Gut health

Gut dysfunction drives systemic inflammation. The gut barrier can become permeable, allowing bacterial components into bloodstream, triggering immune response.

**Support gut health:**
- Fiber-rich foods (prebiotics)
- Fermented foods (probiotics)
- Bone broth (glutamine supports gut lining)
- Remove foods you're sensitive to
- Address dysbiosis if present (may need testing)

### Sleep

Sleep deprivation is powerfully inflammatory. Even one night of poor sleep raises inflammatory markers.

Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep. This isn't optional for managing inflammation.

### Movement

Regular exercise is anti-inflammatory — reduces hs-CRP, IL-6, and other markers.

But overtraining is pro-inflammatory. The dose matters.

Aim for regular moderate exercise, daily movement, and adequate recovery.

### Stress management

Chronic psychological stress raises cortisol, which initially suppresses inflammation but creates dysregulation over time, eventually increasing inflammation.

Stress management isn't fluffy — it's metabolically relevant.

Practices: meditation, nature exposure, social connection, adequate rest, meaning and purpose.

### Fasting

Fasting (time-restricted eating, intermittent fasting, periodic longer fasts) reduces inflammatory markers.

The mechanism involves autophagy — cellular cleanup — and metabolic rest.

12-16 hour daily eating windows or occasional longer fasts can help.

### Supplements

**Strong evidence:**
- Omega-3 fish oil (EPA/DHA)
- Curcumin (with black pepper for absorption)
- Vitamin D (if deficient)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Ginger
- Resveratrol
- Quercetin
- Magnesium

Supplements support but don't replace lifestyle factors.

## When to dig deeper

If inflammation markers are elevated despite lifestyle optimization, investigate:

- **Hidden infections**: Dental infections, chronic viral infections, parasites
- **Heavy metal toxicity**: Mercury, lead, cadmium
- **Mold exposure**: Mycotoxin illness is inflammatory
- **Autoimmune processes**: May need immunological workup
- **Gut issues**: SIBO, dysbiosis, parasites, infections

Sometimes there's a specific driver that needs identification and treatment.

## The inflammation connection to mental health

Depression and anxiety are increasingly understood as inflammatory conditions in many cases.

Brain inflammation (neuroinflammation) affects neurotransmitter function, creates brain fog, disrupts mood regulation.

Many people find that addressing inflammation improves mental health — sometimes dramatically.

The body and mind aren't separate. An inflamed body often means an inflamed brain.

## Measuring progress

If you make changes, retest inflammatory markers:
- hs-CRP is the most accessible
- Retest after 3-6 months of changes
- Look for trends, not single data points

Also track symptoms:
- Energy levels
- Mental clarity
- Joint pain
- Mood
- Sleep quality

Subjective and objective measures together tell the story.

## The integration

Inflammation isn't a single disease. It's a state. A background condition that accelerates aging and enables disease.

Managing inflammation isn't about taking anti-inflammatory supplements while maintaining an inflammatory lifestyle.

It's about reducing inflammatory inputs (diet, stress, poor sleep, sedentary behavior) while increasing anti-inflammatory inputs (movement, sleep, whole foods, connection, nature).

The body wants to return to balance. Remove what's driving inflammation, add what resolves it, and the body often heals itself.

This is foundational. Address inflammation, and many downstream problems improve or prevent.

Don't wait until you have a named disease. The time to address inflammation is now.
