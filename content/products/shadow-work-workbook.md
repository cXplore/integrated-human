# Shadow Work Workbook
## A 30-Day Journey Into Wholeness

**Price: $29**

---

# INTRODUCTION

## Welcome

You're holding a map to the parts of yourself you've hidden.

For the next 30 days, you'll be doing the work most people avoid their entire lives: meeting your shadow. The rejected, denied, suppressed parts of yourself that didn't disappear when you pushed them away—they just went underground, where they've been running your life without your consent.

This workbook will guide you through a structured journey of discovery, confrontation, and integration. It won't be comfortable. Real growth never is. But on the other side is something worth the discomfort: wholeness.

## What is the Shadow?

Carl Jung described the shadow as everything about yourself that you've rejected, denied, or hidden from conscious awareness.

As children, we learn what's acceptable. We learn which emotions are okay, which behaviors get rewarded, which parts of ourselves earn love. The parts that don't fit get pushed into the unconscious.

But buried isn't gone. The shadow:
- Leaks out in ways you don't control
- Gets projected onto others
- Sabotages your goals and relationships
- Drains energy that could be used for living
- Keeps you fragmented instead of whole

## What This Workbook Will Do

Over 30 days, you will:

**Week 1: Locate** — Find where your shadow lives through projection, patterns, and honest self-examination

**Week 2: Meet** — Encounter specific shadow parts through dialogue, imagination, and embodied practice

**Week 3: Understand** — Explore the origins and functions of your shadow material

**Week 4: Integrate** — Begin the process of welcoming shadow parts home

## How to Use This Workbook

**Daily commitment:** 20-30 minutes per day

**Write by hand** when possible—it bypasses defenses better than typing

**Be honest.** No one will see this but you. The value is in truth, not performance.

**Don't skip days.** The structure is designed to build. Skipping creates gaps.

**Get support if needed.** If material surfaces that feels overwhelming, work with a therapist.

**Trust the process.** Some days will feel productive, others will feel stuck. Both are part of the journey.

# WEEK 1: LOCATE THE SHADOW

## Day 1: The Trigger Inventory

The shadow is most visible in your reactions to others. Today, we map your triggers.

**Part 1: List 5-7 people who trigger strong negative reactions in you.**

These can be people you know, public figures, or fictional characters. Choose people who really bother you—not mild irritation, but strong reaction.

1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________
4. _________________________________
5. _________________________________
6. _________________________________
7. _________________________________

**Part 2: For each person, complete this sentence:**

"I can't stand that they are so _____________"

1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________
4. _________________________________
5. _________________________________
6. _________________________________
7. _________________________________

**Part 3: Reflection**

Look at your list of qualities. These are likely shadow material—parts of yourself you've rejected and now see in others.

Choose the quality that provokes the strongest reaction. Write about:

- Why does this quality bother me so much?
- When did I learn this quality was unacceptable?
- Where might this quality exist in me, even in subtle or hidden form?

_______________________________________________

**Closing reflection:** What surprised you today?

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

## Day 2: The Persona Inventory

The persona is the mask you show the world—the opposite of shadow. Today, we examine what you present versus what you hide.

**Part 1: How I present myself**

Complete these sentences:

I want people to see me as: _________________________________

I work hard to appear: _________________________________

The image I try to project is: _________________________________

I would hate for people to think I'm: _________________________________

**Part 2: The gap**

For each quality you try to project, write its opposite. This opposite often lives in shadow.

| I try to appear... | The opposite (shadow?) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| _________________ | _________________ |
| _________________ | _________________ |
| _________________ | _________________ |
| _________________ | _________________ |

**Part 3: Deep reflection**

Choose one quality from the "opposite" column. Write about:

- Do I ever feel or act this way, even secretly?
- What would happen if people saw this side of me?
- What am I protecting by keeping this hidden?

## Day 3: The Recurring Pattern

Patterns that repeat in your life point to unconscious shadow material. Today, we examine what keeps happening.

**Part 1: Pattern identification**

Identify a pattern that keeps recurring in your life. This could be:
- The same relationship dynamic with different people
- The same conflict at every job
- The same self-sabotage at the same point

_______________________________________________

**Part 2: Pattern anatomy**

Answer these questions about your pattern:

What typically triggers the pattern?
_______________________________________________

How do I feel when I'm in it?
_______________________________________________

How do I typically behave?
_______________________________________________

How does it usually end?
_______________________________________________

**Part 3: Shadow hunting**

Now dig deeper:

What belief about myself or the world would create this pattern?
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

What am I getting out of this pattern? (There's always a hidden payoff)
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

What would I have to face or feel if this pattern stopped?
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

What part of me might be creating this pattern, and why?
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

## Day 4: The Body's Shadow

The body stores what the mind won't process. Today, we access shadow through the body.

Which shadow part are you ready to formally welcome home?

Speak aloud or write:

"[Shadow part], I see you now. I understand why you've been hidden. I know you've been trying to protect me.

I no longer need you to stay in exile. You belong here, as part of me.

I welcome you home.

What you carry—[name the quality]—is not shameful. It is part of being human. It is part of being me.

I make room for you now. I will learn to express you in healthy ways. I will no longer spend energy keeping you in the dark.

Come home."

What have I been projecting onto them?
_______________________________________________

How can I own this quality in myself?
_______________________________________________

**Part 2: The inner statement**

Write a statement reclaiming the projection:

"What I've been criticizing in [person] as [quality]—I recognize this exists in me too, as [how it shows up in you]. I take responsibility for my own [quality] instead of seeing it only in others."

_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

**Part 3: What changes in the relationship?**

If you truly owned this projection, how might the relationship change?

**Part 2: Body process**

Stand up. Let your body take a posture that represents this shadow part as rejected/hidden.
