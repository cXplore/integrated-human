# WEEK 1: FOUNDATION

## Video Lesson: The Four Pillars of Integration

**Script outline:**

Welcome to The Integration Path.

For the next 8 weeks, you'll be doing the work of becoming whole. Not perfect—whole. Not fixed—integrated.

Let me explain what we're doing and why.

**What is integration?**

Integration is the opposite of fragmentation. Most people are fragmented:
- Mind disconnected from body
- Emotions suppressed or overwhelming
- Parts of self at war with other parts
- Past running the present
- Living from conditioning, not essence

Integration means bringing the pieces together. Not eliminating anything—incorporating everything into a functioning whole.

**The four pillars:**

1. **Body** — Your nervous system, your somatic experience, your physical being. The body holds what the mind won't face. Integration includes the body.

2. **Shadow** — The parts of yourself you've rejected. They didn't disappear; they went underground. Integration means welcoming them home.

3. **Emotions** — The capacity to feel fully without being overwhelmed. Not suppression, not drowning—flow.

4. **Relationships** — Your patterns with others reveal your inner world. Integration changes how you relate.

And two more dimensions:

5. **Meaning** — What makes life worth living. Without meaning, even a "healthy" person feels empty.

6. **Purpose** — The direction your life wants to move. Your unique contribution.

**The integration framework:**

Over these 8 weeks, we'll work systematically through each pillar:

Weeks 1-2: Foundation and Body
Weeks 3-4: Shadow and Emotions
Weeks 5-6: Patterns and Relationships
Weeks 7-8: Meaning and Integration

Each week builds on the last. Don't skip ahead.

**What you'll need:**
- 45-60 minutes daily
- A journal
- Willingness to be uncomfortable
- Commitment to the full 8 weeks

Let's begin.

# WEEK 2: BODY

## Video Lesson: The Body Keeps the Score

**Script outline:**

This week, we work with the body.

Most people live from the neck up. They think their way through life, treating the body as a vehicle for the brain.

But the body isn't just a vehicle. It's you. And it holds what the mind won't face.

**The nervous system runs the show**

Before you consciously react to anything, your nervous system has already assessed the situation and begun responding.

Three states:
1. **Ventral vagal** — Safe, connected, present
2. **Sympathetic** — Fight/flight, activated, stressed
3. **Dorsal vagal** — Freeze/shutdown, collapsed, numb

Most people are stuck in sympathetic (chronic stress) or bounce between sympathetic and dorsal.

Integration requires a regulated nervous system. You can't do deep inner work from survival mode.

**The body stores trauma**

The body stores what the mind won't process. Trauma, unprocessed emotions, chronic stress—all live in the tissue.

This isn't metaphor. It's literal. Your posture, your tension patterns, your breath habits—all are shaped by your history.

**Somatic awareness**

The first step is awareness. Most people don't know what they're feeling in their body until it becomes pain.

This week, we develop body awareness.

**Regulation as foundation**

Once you can feel the body, you can regulate it. Shifting your nervous system state is a skill.

This week's practices build this skill.

---

## Written Deep Dive: Understanding Your Nervous System

### The Polyvagal Ladder

**Ventral vagal (top of ladder):**
- Safe and connected
- Social engagement active
- Can think clearly
- Present

Signs: relaxed face, easy eye contact, normal breathing, calm but alert

**Sympathetic (middle of ladder):**
- Mobilized for action
- Fight or flight
- Scanning for threat
- Reactive

Signs: racing heart, shallow breath, muscle tension, irritability, restlessness

**Dorsal vagal (bottom of ladder):**
- Immobilized
- Shutdown/freeze
- Dissociated
- Collapsed

Signs: numbness, foggy brain, low energy, wanting to hide, disconnection

### Your Pattern

**Which state is your home base?**

Most people default to one state under stress. Which is yours?

- I tend toward sympathetic (anxious, activated, can't relax)
- I tend toward dorsal (numb, foggy, withdrawn)
- I oscillate between them

**Your triggers:**

What puts you in sympathetic (fight/flight)?
_______________________________________________

What puts you in dorsal (freeze/shutdown)?
_______________________________________________

What helps you return to ventral (calm/connected)?
_______________________________________________

---

## Daily Practice: Nervous System Regulation

**15 minutes daily this week**

### Morning (5 min)
- Physiological sigh x 3 (double inhale, long exhale)
- Body scan: notice without changing
- Set intention for nervous system awareness today

### Midday Check-in (2 min)
- Where am I on the ladder? (Ventral/Sympathetic/Dorsal)
- What does my body need right now?
- One regulatory action

### Evening (8 min)
- Extended exhale breathing (4 in, 8 out) for 3 minutes
- Body scan with release: exhale tension from each area
- Completion: "Today is complete"

---

## Weekly Exercise: The Body Map

**45 minutes**

You'll need: large paper and colored markers (or print a body outline)

1. Draw or print a body outline
2. Close eyes, scan your body
3. Mark areas of chronic tension (red)
4. Mark areas of numbness (blue)
5. Mark areas that feel alive/good (green)
6. Mark areas you avoid/ignore (yellow)

**Reflection questions:**
- What patterns do you notice?
- What is each area holding?
- If each area could speak, what would it say?
- What does your body map reveal about your history?

---

## Journaling Prompts

1. What is your relationship with your body? When did it become this way?
2. What has your body held that your mind wouldn't process?
3. What would it mean to truly inhabit your body?
4. Where do you abandon your body (through numbing, ignoring, overriding)?

---

# WEEK 3: SHADOW

## Video Lesson: Meeting the Rejected Self

**Script outline:**

This week, we enter shadow territory.

The shadow is everything about yourself you've rejected—pushed out of awareness because it wasn't safe or acceptable.

**How shadow forms:**

As a child, you learned what was okay to be and what wasn't. Parts that didn't fit got exiled. They didn't disappear—they went into shadow.

**Where shadow shows up:**

1. **Projection** — You see your shadow in others and react strongly
2. **Leaking** — The shadow comes out sideways, uncontrolled
3. **Symptoms** — Depression, anxiety, addiction often have shadow roots
4. **Patterns** — Relationships repeat because of shadow dynamics

**This week:**

We'll locate your shadow material, meet it through dialogue, and begin the process of integration.

Shadow work is not comfortable. That's the point. Real growth lives at the edge of comfort.

---

## Written Deep Dive: Shadow Work Methods

### Method 1: Projection Analysis

What you can't stand in others is usually shadow.

**Exercise:**
1. List people who trigger strong negative reactions
2. Identify the quality that bothers you most
3. Ask: Where does this exist in me?

### Method 2: Opposite Mining

What you're proud of NOT being usually points to shadow.

**Exercise:**
1. Complete: "I'm not the kind of person who..."
2. For each, ask: "Is there any part of me that is, wants to be, or could be this?"

### Method 3: Dream Work

Shadow material often appears in dreams.

**Exercise:**
1. Record dreams this week
2. For threatening or strange figures, ask: "What if this is a part of me?"
3. Dialogue with dream figures in journaling

### Method 4: Body Tracking

Shadow lives in the body.

**Exercise:**
1. When triggered, notice where you feel it
2. Ask the body sensation: "What are you?"
3. Let it speak

---

## Daily Practice: Shadow Awareness

**15 minutes daily this week**

### Morning (5 min)
- Ask: "What am I avoiding feeling/being today?"
- Set intention to notice triggers

### Evening (10 min)
- **Trigger log:** What triggered me today? What quality in them bothered me?
- **Shadow check:** Where might this quality exist in me?
- **Body check:** Where do I feel this in my body?

---

## Weekly Exercise: Shadow Dialogue

**45 minutes**

1. From your trigger log, choose the quality that provoked the strongest reaction
2. Personify it: Let it take a form (figure, creature, character)
3. Write a dialogue:

You: "I want to understand you. What do you want me to know?"
Shadow: _______________

You: "Why are you here? What is your purpose?"
Shadow: _______________

You: "What do you need from me?"
Shadow: _______________

You: "What gift do you carry?"
Shadow: _______________

4. Reflect: What surprised you? What do you understand now?

---

## Journaling Prompts

1. What parts of yourself have you exiled? When did they go into shadow?
2. What would happen if you allowed these parts to exist?
3. What are you most afraid is true about yourself?
4. What gifts might be hidden in your shadow?
5. Who would you be if you integrated your shadow?

---

# WEEK 4: EMOTIONS

## Video Lesson: Feeling Fully

**Script outline:**

This week is about emotions—the capacity to feel fully without being overwhelmed or shut down.

**The problem with emotions:**

Most people have a dysfunctional relationship with emotion:
- Suppression: pushing emotions down
- Flooding: being overwhelmed by emotion
- Numbing: using substances, screens, busyness to avoid feeling

None of these are healthy.

**What emotions actually are:**

Emotions are energy moving through the body. They're not problems—they're information.

Every emotion has a message. Anger says: "A boundary has been violated." Fear says: "There's a threat to attend to." Grief says: "Something has been lost."

**Healthy emotional flow:**

Emotions arise, are felt, and pass. Like weather. The goal isn't to stop emotions—it's to let them move.

**This week:**

We'll work on emotional awareness, expression, and completion.

---

## Written Deep Dive: The Emotional Cycle

### Healthy emotional flow:

1. **Trigger** — Something happens
2. **Sensation** — Body responds
3. **Recognition** — You identify the emotion
4. **Allowing** — You let yourself feel it
5. **Expression** — The emotion moves (tears, words, movement)
6. **Completion** — The emotion passes
7. **Return** — You return to baseline

### Where it gets stuck:

- **Blocked at recognition:** You don't know what you feel
- **Blocked at allowing:** You suppress as soon as you feel
- **Blocked at expression:** You feel but can't let it out
- **Blocked at completion:** You get stuck in the emotion

### Your pattern:

Where does your emotional cycle typically get blocked?
_______________________________________________

Which emotions are easiest to feel?
_______________________________________________

Which emotions are hardest?
_______________________________________________

---

## Daily Practice: Emotional Check-in

**15 minutes daily this week**

### Morning (3 min)
- Pause. Ask: "What am I feeling right now?"
- Name it. Feel where it lives in your body.
- Let it be here without changing it.

### Throughout Day
- Set 3 reminders to check: "What am I feeling?"
- Don't change it—just notice

### Evening (10 min)
- What emotions moved through me today?
- Which did I allow? Which did I suppress?
- Is anything incomplete? What emotion is still here?
- If incomplete: give it expression (write, move, sound)

---

## Weekly Exercise: Emotional Completion

**45 minutes — In private, uninterrupted**

1. **Identify an incomplete emotion** — Something you've been carrying, suppressing, not fully feeling

2. **Create safe space** — Private location, tissues nearby, timer set

3. **Invoke the emotion** — Think about what triggered it. Let yourself feel it.

4. **Amplify slightly** — Let it grow. Don't push it down.

5. **Express** — Let the emotion move:
   - Grief: sob, wail, curl up
   - Anger: punch pillows, stomp, growl
   - Fear: shake, tremble, speak the fear

6. **Stay with it** — Don't stop partway. Let the wave complete.

7. **Rest** — When the wave passes naturally, rest. Breathe. Ground.

8. **Reflect:** What was released? How do you feel now?

---

## Journaling Prompts

1. What emotions were allowed in your family? Which were forbidden?
2. What emotion have you been avoiding feeling?
3. What do you fear would happen if you fully felt your feelings?
4. What message is your most persistent emotion trying to deliver?

□ I understand the emotional cycle and where mine gets stuck
□ I've practiced emotional check-ins daily
□ I completed the emotional completion exercise
□ I've journaled on at least 3 prompts
□ I'm more aware of emotions as they arise
□ I'm developing capacity to feel without drowning

---

# WEEK 5: PATTERNS

## Video Lesson: The Patterns Running Your Life

**Script outline:**

This week, we examine patterns—the unconscious programs running your life.

**What patterns are:**

Patterns are automatic ways of responding that developed early in life. They're not random—they were adaptive. They helped you survive.

But survival strategies become prisons when the original threat is gone.

**Key patterns to examine:**

1. **Attachment patterns** — How you relate to closeness
2. **Defense mechanisms** — How you protect yourself
3. **Repetition compulsion** — Why you recreate the familiar

**This week:**

We'll map your patterns, understand their origins, and begin creating choice where there was only compulsion.

---

## Written Deep Dive: Attachment Patterns

### The Four Styles

**Secure:** Comfortable with intimacy and independence. Can depend on others and be depended upon. Relationships feel relatively easy.

**Anxious:** Fear abandonment. Need reassurance. Hypervigilant to relationship cues. Tend to pursue when partners pull away.

**Avoidant:** Uncomfortable with closeness. Value independence highly. Tend to withdraw when partners want more connection.

**Disorganized:** Fear both closeness and distance. Approach-avoidance pattern. Often have trauma history.

### Your Pattern

Based on your relationship history:

My primary attachment pattern is: _______________

This shows up as:
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

This pattern developed because:
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

---

## Daily Practice: Pattern Awareness

**15 minutes daily this week**

### Morning (5 min)
- Ask: "What patterns might show up today?"
- Set intention to observe without autopilot

### Evening (10 min)
- **Pattern log:** What patterns ran today?
- When did I operate on autopilot?
- What triggered the pattern?
- What was I protecting by running this pattern?
- Was there a moment I had choice?

---

## Weekly Exercise: Relationship Pattern Map

**60 minutes**

1. List your 5 most significant relationships (romantic, family, close friendships)

2. For each, answer:
   - What pattern did I play?
   - What pattern did they play?
   - How did these patterns interact?
   - What was familiar about this dynamic?
   - How did it end or where is it stuck?

3. Look across all 5:
   - What repeats?
   - What pattern do I consistently bring?
   - What pattern do I attract?
   - What am I trying to work out through these relationships?

4. Reflection:
   - If this pattern continues, where does my life go?
   - What would need to change to create different relationships?

---

## Journaling Prompts

1. What patterns did you learn from your parents' relationship?
2. What are you unconsciously trying to heal through your relationships?
3. What would you have to feel if your patterns stopped running?
4. Describe the relationship you want. What patterns would need to change?
5. If you chose your patterns consciously, what would you choose?

---

□ I understand my attachment pattern
□ I've tracked my patterns daily
□ I completed the relationship pattern map
□ I see what repeats across my relationships
□ I've journaled on at least 3 prompts
□ I'm developing awareness of patterns as they run

---

# WEEK 6: RELATIONSHIPS

## Video Lesson: Conscious Relating

**Script outline:**

This week, we apply everything to relationships.

Relationships are mirrors. They show us our shadow, trigger our wounds, and offer our greatest opportunities for growth.

**The shift to conscious relating:**

Unconscious relating: Autopilot patterns, projections, reenactments
Conscious relating: Awareness, choice, growth-orientation

**This week:**

We'll work on:
- Reclaiming projections
- Communicating needs and boundaries
- Understanding the dance of relationship
- Creating relationships that support integration

---

## Written Deep Dive: Projection in Relationship

### The projection mechanism

When you can't accept something in yourself, you project it onto others. Then you react to them as if THEY are the problem.

**Common projections:**
- Projecting neediness onto partner (when you won't admit your needs)
- Projecting anger onto partner (when you suppress yours)
- Projecting competence onto partner (when you don't trust yourself)
- Projecting shadow qualities (what you've disowned shows up in them)

### Reclaiming projections

1. Notice strong reactions to your partner
2. Ask: "What am I seeing in them that I don't want to see in me?"
3. Own the quality: "I also have this, as..."
4. Notice how the charge decreases

### Your current projections

In your current/recent relationships, what are you projecting?
_______________________________________________

_______________________________________________

What needs to be communicated that hasn't been?
_______________________________________________

**Part 4: Integration**

□ I understand how projection works in my relationships
□ I've tracked relationship dynamics daily
□ I completed the relationship inventory
□ I'm communicating more consciously
□ I've journaled on at least 3 prompts
□ I'm seeing relationships as mirrors for inner work

---

# WEEK 7: MEANING

## Video Lesson: What Makes Life Worth Living

**Script outline:**

This week shifts from psychology to soul.

You can be psychologically "healthy" and still feel empty. Something more is needed: meaning.

**The meaning dimension:**

Meaning comes from:
- Purpose: Knowing why you're here
- Values: Knowing what matters
- Connection: To something larger than yourself
- Contribution: Making a difference

**The role of death:**

Nothing clarifies meaning like mortality. Knowing you will die forces the question: What matters?

**This week:**

We'll explore what gives your life meaning, clarify your values, and use mortality as a teacher.

---

## Written Deep Dive: Values Clarification

### What are values?

Values are what you hold as ultimately important. Not what you're supposed to value—what you actually value, revealed through your choices.

### Values inventory

Rate each value 1-5 (5 = extremely important to me):

- Achievement ___
- Adventure ___
- Authenticity ___
- Beauty ___
- Connection ___
- Creativity ___
- Freedom ___
- Growth ___
- Health ___
- Helping others ___
- Honesty ___
- Independence ___
- Intimacy ___
- Justice ___
- Knowledge ___
- Love ___
- Peace ___
- Pleasure ___
- Power ___
- Recognition ___
- Security ___
- Spirituality ___
- Wisdom ___

**Your top 5 values:**
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________
4. _______________
5. _______________

**Are you living according to these values?**

For each of your top 5, rate 1-10 how aligned your current life is:
1. _______________ : ___/10
2. _______________ : ___/10
3. _______________ : ___/10
4. _______________ : ___/10
5. _______________ : ___/10

---

## Daily Practice: Meaning Awareness

**15 minutes daily this week**

### Morning (5 min)
- Ask: "What could make today meaningful?"
- Set intention aligned with your values

### Evening (10 min)
- What gave today meaning?
- Where did I live according to my values?
- Where did I violate my values?
- What would make tomorrow more meaningful?

---

## Weekly Exercise: The Death Meditation

**45 minutes — In quiet, reflective space**

1. Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Breathe deeply.

2. Imagine you have one year left to live. You're healthy until the end, then you die.

3. Reflect:
   - What becomes immediately unimportant?
   - What becomes urgent?
   - Who would you spend time with?
   - What would you stop doing?
   - What would you start doing?
   - What would you need to say?
   - What would you need to complete?

4. Now imagine one month.
   - What changes?
   - What becomes essential?

5. Now imagine one week.
   - What is absolutely essential?

6. Open your eyes. Write:

If I only had a year, I would:
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

If I only had a month:
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

If I only had a week:
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

**What does this reveal about what actually matters?**
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

**What changes now, as a result of this reflection?**
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

2. What would give your life meaning that's currently missing?
3. What purpose do you sense, even if you can't name it clearly?
4. What would you regret not doing/being if you died tomorrow?
5. How does awareness of death change how you want to live?
