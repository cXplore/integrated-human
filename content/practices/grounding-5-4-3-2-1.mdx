## The Practice

When you're caught in anxiety or dissociation, your attention has left your body and the present moment. This practice uses your five senses to bring you back.

### Instructions

Take a breath. Then, either out loud or silently, notice:

**5 things you can SEE**
Look around and name them. "I see the lamp. I see the window. I see my hands..."

**4 things you can TOUCH**
Feel the texture of your clothes, the chair beneath you, your feet on the floor...

**3 things you can HEAR**
The hum of appliances, traffic outside, your own breathing...

**2 things you can SMELL**
This might require moving around or sniffing your clothes, coffee, anything nearby...

**1 thing you can TASTE**
What's in your mouth right now? Residue of coffee? Just... mouth?

### Tips

- Speak out loud if you're alone — it engages more of your brain
- Really look, really feel. Don't just list, actually experience each sense
- If you can't find something for a category, make something up that you could sense
- You can repeat this multiple times if needed

### When to Use

- During anxiety attacks
- When you feel "floaty" or disconnected
- After a triggering memory or flashback
- When you notice you've been lost in thought for too long
- Before important events where you need to be present

### Why It Works

Anxiety and dissociation pull your attention into the past (rumination) or future (worry). Your senses only work in the present. By engaging all five senses deliberately, you're forcing your nervous system to acknowledge: "I am here, now. I am in a body. I am safe enough to notice these things."
