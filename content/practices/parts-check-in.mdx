We all have different parts—the part that wants to work hard, the part that wants to rest, the part that's afraid, the part that's confident. This practice helps you check in with them.

## How to Practice

1. **Settle and close your eyes**

2. **Scan inward** and notice what's present. Ask: "What parts are active right now?"

3. **Identify the parts** you notice. You might find:
   - A worried part
   - A critical part
   - An excited part
   - A tired part
   - A resistant part
   - Others unique to you

4. **Greet each part** with curiosity: "Hello, I notice you're here"

5. **Ask each part**:
   - "What are you feeling?"
   - "What are you concerned about?"
   - "What do you need?"

6. **Listen** without trying to change anything

7. **Thank each part** for sharing

8. **Notice how you feel** after giving each part attention

## Working with Conflicting Parts

When parts disagree:
1. Acknowledge both parts
2. Let each one speak without interruption
3. Find what they have in common (often protecting the same thing)
4. Ask if they'd be willing to work together

## Why It Works

Internal conflicts drain energy and create stuckness. When all parts feel heard and understood, they stop fighting and can work together. Integration happens through relationship, not suppression.

## When to Use

- When you feel internal conflict
- Before making decisions
- When you're stuck or resisting something
- As regular inner-world maintenance
