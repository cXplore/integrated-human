Not all activities are equal. Some energize you; some drain you. This practice helps you see the patterns clearly.

## How to Practice

### Create Your Inventory

Make two lists:

**Energy Givers** (activities, people, environments that energize):
- What do you do that leaves you feeling more alive?
- Who are you with when you feel most energized?
- What environments lift your energy?

**Energy Drains** (activities, people, environments that deplete):
- What do you do that leaves you exhausted beyond the effort involved?
- Who are you with when you feel drained?
- What environments sap your energy?

### Analyze Your Lists

For each item, rate its impact (1-5 for energy given/drained) and frequency (how often it occurs).

Calculate your energy budget:
- Are you spending more than you're earning?
- Where are the biggest drains?
- Where are the biggest untapped sources?

### Make Changes

Based on your inventory:
1. Increase time with energy givers (even small amounts help)
2. Decrease or restructure energy drains where possible
3. Create boundaries around drains you can't eliminate
4. Stack: Combine neutral activities with energy givers

## Why It Works

Energy management is more important than time management. You can have plenty of time but no energy to use it. By understanding your specific energy patterns, you can make choices that sustain rather than deplete you.

## Update Regularly

Your energy patterns change. Review your inventory quarterly and adjust accordingly.
