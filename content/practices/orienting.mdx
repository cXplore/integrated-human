## The Practice

When your nervous system goes into dorsal vagal (freeze/shutdown), you can feel numb, disconnected, foggy, or like you're not quite in your body. This is a survival response — when fight and flight don't work, the system conserves energy by shutting down.

The way out of freeze isn't forcing yourself to feel or pushing through. It's gently reorienting to the present — letting your nervous system know that you're here now, and it's safe to come back online.

### When to Use

- When you feel numb or disconnected
- After a dissociative episode
- When you can't feel your body
- When you feel foggy or "not quite here"
- When you're frozen and can't seem to move
- As prevention when you sense shutdown beginning

### The Practice

**1. Slow Down**

Stop what you're doing. There's no rush. You're not trying to force anything — you're creating conditions for your system to come back naturally.

**2. Look Around — Slowly**

Turn your head slowly to look around the space you're in. Very slowly. Let your eyes land on different objects.

Don't just glance — actually *see* what you're looking at. Notice colors, textures, shapes. Let your gaze linger.

This activates the "orienting response" — a primitive part of your nervous system that helps you assess your environment for safety.

**3. Name What You See**

Silently or out loud, name five things you can see:

*"I see a brown wooden table. I see a blue cushion. I see light coming through the window. I see my hands. I see the door."*

Keep it simple. The point isn't to think deeply — it's to anchor yourself in what's actually here.

**4. Listen**

Pause. What do you hear?

Notice sounds close to you and sounds far away. Traffic. Birds. The hum of electricity. Your own breathing.

*"I hear the refrigerator. I hear cars outside. I hear my breathing."*

**5. Feel Points of Contact**

Without moving, notice where your body touches other surfaces.

*"I feel my feet on the floor. I feel my back against the chair. I feel my hands on my thighs."*

Let yourself really feel the solidity of what's holding you.

**6. Gentle Movement**

If you feel ready, make one small movement. Wiggle your fingers. Turn your head slowly the other way. Shift your weight.

Movement is a signal to your nervous system that you can act — that you're not actually immobilized.

**7. Notice What's Different**

Check in. Do you feel slightly more present? More in your body? Don't judge it — just notice.

If you still feel disconnected, that's okay. Repeat the practice, or give yourself more time.

### Variations

**Touch Something**
If looking isn't enough, add touch. Pick up an object and really feel it — texture, temperature, weight. This adds another sensory channel.

**Temperature**
Hold something cold (ice cube, cold glass) or warm. Temperature can help wake up a frozen system.

**Eyes on the Horizon**
If you can, look at something in the distance — out a window, across a room. Distant focus activates the ventral vagal (social engagement) system.

### What's Happening

The dorsal vagal freeze response is characterized by reduced sensory awareness — your system "dims the lights" to conserve energy. Orienting practices reverse this by deliberately engaging your senses, sending signals to your nervous system that say "I'm here, I'm aware, I can respond."

This is different from the high-activation practices (like shaking or breathwork) that work better for sympathetic activation. When you're shut down, you need gentleness, not intensity.

### A Note on Freeze

You didn't choose to go into freeze. It's a survival mechanism, not a failure. Getting frustrated with yourself for being disconnected just adds another layer of stress.

The goal isn't to never freeze again. It's to learn the way back.

*You're not broken. Your nervous system is doing its job. You're just learning a new way home.*
