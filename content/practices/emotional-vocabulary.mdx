Research shows that precisely naming emotions helps regulate them. This practice builds your emotional vocabulary.

## How to Practice

### Daily Check-In

Three times daily (morning, afternoon, evening), pause and ask:
"What am I feeling right now?"

Instead of stopping at basic words (good, bad, stressed), dig deeper:

**If you feel "bad"**, is it more like:
Disappointed, Frustrated, Anxious, Sad, Irritated, Overwhelmed, Lonely, Ashamed, Resentful, Exhausted, Disconnected, Stuck

**If you feel "good"**, is it more like:
Content, Excited, Peaceful, Grateful, Energized, Hopeful, Connected, Proud, Relieved, Curious, Playful, Loving

### Building Your Vocabulary

Keep an emotion word list. When you encounter a new emotion word that resonates:
1. Write it down
2. Note when you've felt it
3. Note where you feel it in your body
4. Use it next time that feeling arises

### The Emotion Wheel

Use an emotion wheel (easily found online) to:
- Start from core emotions in the center
- Move outward to more nuanced words
- Find the most precise match for your experience

## Why It Works

The act of naming creates distance from the emotion. It shifts brain activity from the reactive amygdala to the thinking prefrontal cortex. More precise names = more specific understanding = better regulation.

## When to Use

- During any emotional experience
- When processing difficult situations
- In journaling
- When communicating feelings to others
