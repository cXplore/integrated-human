## The Practice

When you're stuck in dorsal vagal shutdown (freeze, collapse, numbness), gentle practices often aren't enough. Cold water provides a strong sensory signal that tells your nervous system: "Wake up. You're alive. Things are happening."

This is not about torture. It's about choosing a controlled, brief discomfort to shift your state.

### Basic Version: Face Splash

1. Run cold water in your sink (as cold as it goes)
2. Splash cold water on your face 5-10 times
3. Focus especially on your forehead, cheeks, and around your eyes
4. Breathe through the sensation

This activates the "dive reflex" — a mammalian response that slows heart rate and shifts autonomic state.

### Medium Version: Cold Water on Wrists

1. Run cold water over your inner wrists for 30-60 seconds
2. Breathe slowly while you do it
3. Notice the aliveness in your hands and arms

Major blood vessels are close to the surface here, so cold registers quickly throughout your body.

### Advanced Version: Cold Shower Finish

1. At the end of your normal shower, turn the water cold
2. Start with 15-30 seconds (just enough to gasp)
3. Focus on breathing through it rather than tensing against it
4. Work up to 1-2 minutes over time

### When to Use

- Morning fog or heaviness
- After waking from heavy sleep
- When you feel emotionally numb
- Before something that requires you to be present
- When you notice you've been "checked out" for a while

### Tips

- Start with face splashing — it's gentler than it sounds
- The gasp is normal. Breathe through it.
- Notice how you feel 5 minutes after — that's the real effect
- Don't do cold exposure when already hypothermic or ill

### The Science

Cold activates the sympathetic nervous system in a controlled way. When you're stuck in dorsal (shutdown), you actually need some activation to climb back into your "window of tolerance." Cold also triggers norepinephrine release, which improves mood and focus.
