Your safe place is an internal resource—a mental space you can access whenever you need to feel secure and calm.

## How to Practice

### Creating Your Safe Place

1. **Find a comfortable position** and close your eyes

2. **Imagine a place** where you feel completely safe. It can be:
   - Real (a place you've been)
   - Imaginary (a place you create)
   - A combination of both

3. **Make it vivid** by engaging all senses:
   - What do you see? (Colors, shapes, light, surroundings)
   - What do you hear? (Sounds, silence, ambient noise)
   - What do you feel? (Temperature, textures, ground beneath you)
   - What do you smell? (Scents, fresh air, familiar smells)

4. **Notice how you feel** in this place. Let safety soak into your body

5. **Give it a name or symbol**—a word or image that represents this place

6. **Visit regularly** to strengthen the connection

### Accessing Your Safe Place

When you need it:
1. Close your eyes if possible
2. Recall the name or symbol
3. Let the image arise
4. Spend a minute letting the safety settle into your body
5. Open your eyes when ready, bringing some of that calm with you

## Why It Works

The brain doesn't fully distinguish between vivid imagination and reality. By rehearsing safety in your internal world, you create a resource that affects your actual nervous system.

## Tips

- The safe place doesn't have to be realistic—it just needs to feel safe to you
- Some people include a guardian or protector in their safe place
- Visit your safe place when you're already calm to strengthen it, not just when stressed
