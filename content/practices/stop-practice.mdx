## Why STOP Works

When overwhelmed, we often keep pushing. The mind says "no time to stop, too much to do." But continuing without pausing usually makes things worse.

STOP creates a micro-interruption. Just enough space to shift from reactive to responsive. One minute is enough.

## The Practice

**S - Stop**
Whatever you're doing, pause. Just stop. Put down the phone, stop typing, stop moving. Complete stillness for a moment.

**T - Take a Breath**
One conscious breath. Feel the inhale. Feel the exhale. You don't need to breathe in any special way. Just notice this breath.

**O - Observe**
Notice what's happening right now:
- What sensations are in your body?
- What emotions are present?
- What thoughts are running?
- What's actually happening around you?

No judgment. Just observation.

**P - Proceed**
Now continue with whatever you need to do. But proceed with awareness, not autopilot.

## The Whole Practice

1. Stop (5 seconds)
2. Take a breath (10 seconds)
3. Observe (30 seconds)
4. Proceed (continue with awareness)

Total time: Under one minute.

## When to Use STOP

- Before sending an emotional email
- When you notice you're rushing
- Before difficult conversations
- When stress is escalating
- Between tasks as a transition
- When you catch yourself on autopilot
- Before making a decision
- When you realize you've been holding your breath

## What You Might Observe

**Body**: Tight shoulders, clenched jaw, shallow breathing, stomach tension

**Emotions**: Anxiety, frustration, fear, numbness, sadness

**Thoughts**: "I can't handle this," "There's too much," "What if...," "I should have..."

**Environment**: What's actually happening vs. what you're imagining

## The Key Insight

Often, what you observe during STOP reveals the real issue. You might think you're stressed about the project, but notice you're actually afraid of judgment. You might think you need to work faster, but observe that you need rest.

The pause creates space for truth.

## Variations

**Longer Observe:**
- Spend 2-3 minutes on the observe phase
- Do a brief body scan
- Name three things you see, hear, feel

**STOP with Choice:**
- After observing, ask: "What do I actually need right now?"
- The answer might surprise you

**STOP Alarm:**
- Set random reminders to STOP throughout the day
- Practice when nothing's wrong
- Builds the habit for when you need it

## Making It Stick

The challenge with STOP isn't the practice—it's remembering to use it when overwhelmed.

**Cues that help:**
- Physical sensations (tension = STOP)
- Rushing (noticing speed = STOP)
- Reactivity (urge to snap = STOP)
- Certain locations (entering a room = STOP)

The more you practice when calm, the more available it becomes when stressed.

## The Deeper Layer

You can't control most of what happens. But you can control whether you respond from reactivity or awareness.

STOP is the gateway. One minute of pause can change the trajectory of an hour, a conversation, a decision.

The practice is simple. Remembering to use it is the practice.
