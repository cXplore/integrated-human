## Why This Works

The brain has a negativity bias. It's wired to notice threats, problems, and what's wrong. This kept our ancestors alive but leaves us feeling worse than reality warrants.

Three Good Things directly counters this bias. By deliberately attending to what went well, you train your brain to notice the positive that was always there.

Research shows this simple practice, done consistently, reduces depression and increases life satisfaction for months.

## The Practice

Each evening, write down three things that went well today.

For each one, answer: **Why did this good thing happen?**

That's it.

### Examples

**Good thing**: Had a good conversation with my coworker
**Why it happened**: I made the effort to ask about their weekend, and they opened up

**Good thing**: Finished the project I'd been procrastinating on
**Why it happened**: I broke it into smaller pieces and tackled the easiest part first

**Good thing**: Noticed the sunset on my drive home
**Why it happened**: I was present enough to look up from my thoughts

### Guidelines

- They don't need to be big things
- Include things you contributed to and things that just happened
- Be specific rather than general
- The "why" question is important—don't skip it

## What Makes It Effective

The power is in the combination:

1. **Recall**: Searching memory for positives
2. **Writing**: Making it concrete
3. **Attribution**: Understanding why good things happen

The attribution step is crucial. It helps you see your role in creating positive experiences and notice the support around you.

## Variations

**Morning Version:**
- Write three things you're looking forward to
- After the day, note which ones happened

**Relationship Version:**
- Three good things about your partner/friend
- Share them with the person

**Challenge Version:**
- Three good things that came from a difficult situation
- Builds resilience and reframing skills

**Micro Version:**
- At any moment, name three good things about right now
- Instant perspective shift

## What You Might Notice

- Resistance at first ("nothing good happened")
- Getting easier to find good things over time
- Noticing good things in real-time during the day
- Mood lifting, especially after a week of practice
- Sleep improving (positive last thoughts)

## When to Use This

- Every evening (consistency is key)
- When stuck in negative thinking
- During difficult life periods
- When feeling ungrateful or entitled
- When depression is present

## The Deeper Layer

This isn't about toxic positivity or ignoring problems. The problems are still there. You'll still notice them—the brain makes sure of that.

This practice adds balance. It ensures you also notice what's working, what's good, what you have. Not instead of the difficulties. Alongside them.

The question isn't whether life is good or bad. It's whether you're perceiving all of it, or just the hard parts.

Three good things. Every day. Watch what shifts.
