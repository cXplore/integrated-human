Boundaries are where you end and another person begins. Clear boundaries protect your wellbeing and actually improve relationships.

## How to Practice

### Identify Your Boundaries

Reflect on situations where you felt:
- Resentful (often a sign a boundary was crossed)
- Drained beyond reasonable expectation
- Taken advantage of
- Like you couldn't say no

For each, ask: "What boundary would have protected me here?"

### The Boundary Formula

When setting a boundary, be:
1. **Clear**: State what you need specifically
2. **Kind**: No attack required
3. **Firm**: No justification needed

**Template**: "I'm not able to [thing you're not doing]. What I can do is [alternative if appropriate]."

**Examples**:
- "I'm not able to take calls after 8pm. You can text me and I'll respond in the morning."
- "I'm not able to lend money. I hope you find a solution."
- "I'm not able to discuss this topic with you. Let's talk about something else."

### Practice Saying No

In low-stakes situations, practice:
- "No thanks."
- "That doesn't work for me."
- "I'd rather not."
- "I'm going to pass on that."

Notice: You don't need to explain, justify, or apologize.

## Why It Works

Boundaries create safety—for you and others. People actually respect clear boundaries more than vague discomfort. Without boundaries, resentment builds; with them, genuine connection becomes possible.

## Common Challenges

**Guilt**: Feeling guilty doesn't mean you did something wrong. Boundaries often feel uncomfortable at first.

**Pushback**: Some people will test boundaries. Hold anyway.

**Changing old patterns**: People used to you without boundaries may resist. Consistency helps them adjust.
