Pendulation teaches the nervous system that it can move into difficult territory and come back out—building capacity for handling challenging experiences.

## How to Practice

1. **Establish a resource**: Find a place in your body that feels neutral, pleasant, or stable. This might be your hands, feet, or anywhere that doesn't hold tension

2. **Notice your resource**: Spend 30 seconds really feeling this place. What are the sensations? Temperature? Weight? Texture?

3. **Briefly contact difficulty**: Shift attention to a place of mild discomfort or tension. Don't dive deep—just touch it

4. **Notice what's there**: What sensations? Heat? Pressure? Movement? (Spend 10-20 seconds)

5. **Return to resource**: Shift attention back to the stable place. Notice how it feels to be back

6. **Pendulate**: Continue moving between resource and difficulty, spending more time on resource than difficulty

7. **Track changes**: Does the difficulty shift? Soften? Move? Change character?

## Important Guidelines

- Always work within your window of tolerance
- Keep more attention on resource than difficulty
- Stop if you become overwhelmed
- Start with mild discomfort, not intense material
- This isn't a substitute for trauma therapy

## Why It Works

The nervous system learns through experience that difficult sensations are survivable—and that there's always a way back to safety. Over time, this expands capacity for handling what arises.

## When to Use

- Processing body sensations from stress or emotion
- Building nervous system resilience
- After difficult experiences
- As part of somatic healing work
