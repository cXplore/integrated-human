## The Practice

Conflict in relationships is inevitable. Repair is not. Most people either avoid difficult conversations entirely or rush into them unprepared, making things worse. This practice helps you prepare for a repair conversation — getting clear on what happened, what you need, and what you're willing to offer.

### When to Use

- After an argument or conflict
- When something was said that hurt
- When you hurt someone and want to make it right
- When there's an unresolved tension that's affecting the relationship
- When you've been avoiding a necessary conversation

### Before You Begin

This practice has two parts: reflection (done alone) and conversation (done with the other person). Do the reflection first. Don't rush into the conversation without clarity.

You'll need about 15-20 minutes of quiet time and something to write with.

## Part 1: Reflection

### Step 1: What Happened?

Write down the facts of what happened. Not your interpretations, not your feelings yet — just what actually occurred.

*"We were talking about weekend plans. I said I wanted to see my friends. They said I never make time for them. I got defensive and said that wasn't true. They walked out of the room."*

Keep it simple. Get the sequence clear.

### Step 2: What Was Going On For Me?

Now add your internal experience:

- What was I feeling during the conflict? (angry, scared, hurt, defensive, ashamed)
- What story was I telling myself? ("They don't care about my needs." "I'm always the problem.")
- What need of mine wasn't being met? (autonomy, appreciation, understanding, connection)
- Was I reacting from an old wound or pattern?

Write honestly. This is for you.

### Step 3: What Might Have Been Going On For Them?

Genuine curiosity here. Not making excuses, but imagining:

- What might they have been feeling?
- What might they have needed?
- What might have touched an old wound in them?
- Is there any way their reaction makes sense, given their experience?

You might be wrong. That's okay. You're practicing empathy, not mind-reading.

### Step 4: What's My Part?

This is hard but essential. Where did you contribute to the problem?

- Did I dismiss their concern?
- Did I get defensive instead of listening?
- Did I escalate when I could have softened?
- Did I say something hurtful?
- Did I shut down instead of staying present?

Write it down. Owning your part doesn't mean the whole thing was your fault. It means taking responsibility for what was yours.

### Step 5: What Do I Need?

- What do I need to feel resolved?
- Is there something I need to hear from them?
- Is there something I need to say?
- What would repair look like for me?

### Step 6: What Am I Willing to Offer?

- Am I willing to apologize for my part?
- Am I willing to listen to their experience?
- Am I willing to make a concrete change?
- What can I offer to help repair this?

## Part 2: The Conversation

When you're ready, approach the other person. Here's a structure:

**1. Ask Permission**

*"I've been thinking about what happened. Can we talk about it? Is now a good time?"*

If they're not ready, respect that. Set a time for later.

**2. Own Your Part First**

Start with accountability, not accusations:

*"I want to apologize for how I reacted. When you said you felt like I never make time for you, I got defensive instead of listening. That wasn't fair."*

**3. Express Your Experience Without Blame**

Use "I" statements:

*"I felt hurt because it seemed like my needs didn't matter. I realize that's not necessarily what you meant."*

**4. Be Curious About Their Experience**

*"Can you tell me more about what was going on for you? I want to understand."*

Then actually listen. Don't plan your response. Don't defend. Just take it in.

**5. Clarify Needs**

*"What do you need from me right now? And here's what I need..."*

**6. Make a Request or Offer**

*"Can we agree that next time this comes up, we'll try to pause before it escalates?"*

Or: *"I'm going to work on not getting defensive. Would you be willing to tell me if I'm doing better?"*

**7. Acknowledge What Was Good**

Even in conflict, something was right — maybe just the willingness to engage.

*"I'm glad we can talk about this. It matters to me that we can repair things."*

### Tips for the Conversation

- Stay regulated. If you get flooded, take a break.
- One issue at a time. Don't bring up the last five conflicts.
- Don't expect perfection. Repair is messy. The attempt matters.
- If it's not going well, pause: "I don't think we're getting anywhere right now. Can we try again later?"

### When Repair Isn't Possible

Sometimes the other person isn't willing or able to repair. In that case:

- You can still do your part (apologize, own your contribution)
- You can grieve what can't be fixed
- You can decide what you need going forward

You can't force repair. You can only make yourself available for it.

*Relationships are built not by avoiding rupture, but by surviving it together.*
