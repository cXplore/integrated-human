Sometimes emotions or memories arise that you can't process right now. The container practice creates a safe place to put them until you're ready.

## How to Practice

### Creating Your Container

1. **Imagine a container** large enough and strong enough to hold difficult material:
   - A safe or vault
   - A treasure chest
   - A locked room
   - A sturdy box
   - Whatever feels secure to you

2. **Make it vivid**:
   - What does it look like?
   - What material is it made of?
   - How does it lock or seal?
   - Where is it located?

3. **Know it's secure**: Nothing can get out unless you choose

### Using Your Container

When something difficult arises that you can't process now:

1. Acknowledge what's arising
2. Tell it: "I see you. I'll come back to this, but not now."
3. Visualize placing it in your container
4. Seal the container
5. Return your attention to the present

### Coming Back to Contents

When you're ready to process:
1. Set up support (therapist, trusted friend, safe space)
2. Open the container intentionally
3. Take out only what you're ready to work with
4. Process with appropriate support
5. Return what's not fully processed

## Why It Works

Some material is too much for the moment—but suppression isn't healthy either. The container acknowledges the material exists while creating appropriate boundaries around when and how to engage with it.

## Important Notes

- This is for temporary containment, not permanent avoidance
- Use professional support for trauma or very difficult material
- The container supplements therapy; it doesn't replace it
