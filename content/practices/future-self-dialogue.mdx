Your future self—5, 10, or 20 years ahead—has lived through what you're facing now. This practice accesses that wisdom.

## How to Practice

1. **Settle into a comfortable position** and close your eyes

2. **Choose a time horizon**—5, 10, or 20 years into the future

3. **Visualize meeting your future self**. Imagine walking toward them. Notice:
   - How do they carry themselves?
   - What's in their eyes?
   - What energy do they radiate?
   - What have they been through?

4. **Greet them** and feel their warmth toward you

5. **Ask your questions**:
   - "What do I need to know right now?"
   - "What would you do differently if you were me?"
   - "What's not as important as I think it is?"
   - "What matters more than I realize?"
   - "What am I ready for that I don't see?"

6. **Listen** for whatever comes—words, images, feelings

7. **Thank them** and return to the present, bringing what you received

## Why It Works

Your unconscious mind holds more wisdom than your conscious mind can access. This practice creates a structure for that wisdom to speak—in a form that feels trustworthy and loving.

## Variations

- Write a letter to your future self
- Write a letter from your future self
- Ask a specific question before sleeping and notice what comes

## When to Use

- When facing difficult decisions
- When you need encouragement
- When you've lost perspective
- For goal setting and life planning
