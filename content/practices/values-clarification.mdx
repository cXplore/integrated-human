Knowing your values provides a compass for decisions large and small. This practice helps you identify what truly matters to you.

## How to Practice

### Step 1: Generate Your Values List

Review this list and circle any that resonate:

Achievement, Adventure, Authenticity, Balance, Beauty, Belonging, Compassion, Connection, Courage, Creativity, Curiosity, Excellence, Family, Freedom, Fun, Growth, Health, Honesty, Honor, Humor, Independence, Integrity, Intimacy, Justice, Kindness, Knowledge, Leadership, Learning, Love, Loyalty, Mastery, Nature, Peace, Play, Power, Recognition, Respect, Security, Service, Simplicity, Spirituality, Stability, Tradition, Trust, Wisdom

Add any values not on the list that matter to you.

### Step 2: Narrow to Top 10

From your circled values, select the 10 most important.

### Step 3: Prioritize to Top 5

If you could only honor 5 values for the rest of your life, which would they be? Rank them 1-5.

### Step 4: Define What They Mean

For each of your top 5, write:
- What this value means to you specifically
- How you express it when you're living it well
- How you feel when this value is violated

### Step 5: Assess Current Alignment

Rate how well your current life aligns with each value (1-10). Where are the gaps?

## Why It Works

Values act as decision filters. When facing a choice, you can ask: "Which option better serves my values?" This creates consistency and reduces decision fatigue.

## When to Use

- When facing major life decisions
- When something feels "off" but you can't name it
- Annually, to check alignment
- During periods of transition
