The brain is wired to notice threats more than pleasures. Savoring deliberately balances this by fully absorbing positive experiences.

## How to Practice

When something pleasant happens—even something small:

1. **Notice it's happening**. Most pleasant moments slip by unnoticed

2. **Pause**. Don't rush to the next thing

3. **Absorb it fully**:
   - What sensations are present in your body?
   - What emotions are arising?
   - What details can you notice?

4. **Extend the moment**. Stay with it 10-30 seconds longer than you normally would

5. **Intensify deliberately**:
   - What makes this especially good?
   - How fortunate to be experiencing this
   - Really let it sink in

6. **Store the memory**. Imagine this experience becoming part of you

## What to Savor

- Morning coffee or tea
- A moment of sunlight
- A kind interaction
- Physical comfort
- Beauty you notice
- Accomplishments (even small ones)
- Loving moments with others
- Nature encounters
- Music that moves you
- Good food

## Why It Works

Neurons that fire together wire together. By deliberately extending positive experiences, you strengthen the neural pathways associated with wellbeing. Over time, this shifts your baseline.

## When to Use

- Throughout the day, whenever something pleasant happens
- Especially during periods of stress or difficulty
- To counterbalance the brain's negativity bias
