Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) teaches your body the difference between tension and relaxation, allowing you to consciously release held tension.

## How to Practice

Work through each muscle group:

1. **Feet:** Curl your toes tightly for 5 seconds, then release for 10 seconds
2. **Calves:** Point your toes toward your head, hold, release
3. **Thighs:** Squeeze your thigh muscles, hold, release
4. **Glutes:** Clench your buttocks, hold, release
5. **Abdomen:** Tighten your stomach muscles, hold, release
6. **Chest:** Take a deep breath and hold, then release
7. **Hands:** Make tight fists, hold, release
8. **Arms:** Flex your biceps, hold, release
9. **Shoulders:** Raise shoulders toward ears, hold, release
10. **Face:** Scrunch your face, hold, release

After completing all groups, notice the overall sense of relaxation in your body.

## Why It Works

By deliberately creating tension first, you become more aware of what relaxation actually feels like. This contrast helps your nervous system learn to let go.

## When to Use

- Before sleep to release daily tension
- During high-stress periods
- When you notice you're holding tension but can't release it
- As a regular relaxation practice
