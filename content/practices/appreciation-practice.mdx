Appreciation is like water for relationships. Most people underestimate how much it matters and how rarely they express it.

## How to Practice

### The Daily Practice

Each day, genuinely appreciate one person in your life:

1. **Notice something specific** they did or are
2. **Tell them directly**:
   - What they did
   - How it affected you
   - Why it matters

### The Formula

"I noticed [specific action]. It made me feel [impact on you]. Thank you."

Examples:
- "I noticed you made coffee this morning before I was up. It made me feel taken care of. Thank you."
- "I noticed how patiently you explained that to me. It made me feel respected. Thank you."
- "I noticed you remembered what I said about my project. It made me feel seen. Thank you."

### Beyond Words

Appreciation can also be expressed through:
- A written note
- An unexpected gesture
- Quality attention
- Acts of service
- Thoughtful gifts

## Why It Works

People don't feel appreciated—they feel expressions of appreciation. What's felt inside but not communicated doesn't count. Regular expressed appreciation creates a positive relationship climate where both people feel valued.

## Advanced Practice

Notice 5 things you appreciate about someone before any conversation with them. This shifts your internal state toward them and changes how the interaction unfolds.

## When to Use

- Daily with people close to you
- Whenever you notice something to appreciate
- When relationships feel distant or tense
- As a preventive relationship maintenance practice
