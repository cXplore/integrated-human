Morning Pages, from Julia Cameron's "The Artist's Way," are three pages of longhand writing done first thing in the morning, before the conscious mind fully engages.

## How to Practice

1. **Write first thing** after waking, before coffee, news, or conversation

2. **Write three full pages** by hand (about 750 words)

3. **Write whatever comes**—there is no wrong way to do this:
   - Complaints, dreams, worries, observations
   - "I don't know what to write, this is dumb..."
   - Lists, fragments, nonsense
   - Whatever is in your head

4. **Don't stop** until you've filled three pages

5. **Don't read what you've written** (at least not right away)

6. **Do this daily**, ideally without exception

## The Rules

- Longhand only (not typing)
- First thing in the morning
- Don't edit, censor, or judge
- Don't stop until three pages are complete
- Don't read them back (for at least a few weeks)

## Why It Works

Morning pages drain the swamp of anxious, repetitive, critical thoughts that sit on top of the mind. By dumping this material onto paper, you clear space for creativity, clarity, and insight. You're not writing to produce something—you're writing to clear out what's in the way.

## Common Resistance

"I'm not a writer" — You don't need to be. This isn't about quality.
"I don't have time" — Wake 30 minutes earlier. It's worth it.
"I don't know what to write" — Write that. Keep writing it until something else comes.
