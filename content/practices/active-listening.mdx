Active listening is fully receiving another person without agenda—one of the most powerful gifts you can give.

## How to Practice

### The Basics

In your next conversation, focus on:

1. **Full attention**
   - Put away devices
   - Face the person
   - Make appropriate eye contact
   - Let go of what you want to say next

2. **Non-verbal presence**
   - Nod to show you're following
   - Keep an open posture
   - Match their energy appropriately
   - Don't rush to fill silences

3. **Verbal reflection**
   - "It sounds like you're feeling..."
   - "So what you're saying is..."
   - "That must have been..."

4. **Questions that deepen**
   - "What was that like for you?"
   - "How did that affect you?"
   - "What else is there about that?"

### What to Avoid

- Preparing your response while they're talking
- Jumping to advice or solutions
- Relating everything back to yourself
- Judging or evaluating what they share
- Finishing their sentences

## Formal Practice

Set aside 15 minutes with a partner:
1. One person speaks for 5 minutes about something meaningful
2. The other person only listens—no talking except brief reflections
3. At the end, the listener summarizes what they heard
4. The speaker confirms or clarifies
5. Switch roles

## Why It Works

Most people listen to respond, not to understand. When someone feels truly heard—without judgment, without advice, without agenda—something shifts. Trust deepens. Connection happens. And often, the speaker finds their own clarity.

## When to Use

- Any conversation, but especially important ones
- When someone is struggling
- When you notice relationship distance
- To deepen intimacy
