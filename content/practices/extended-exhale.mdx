## The Science

Your exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system through the vagus nerve. When you exhale longer than you inhale, you signal safety to your body. Heart rate slows. Blood pressure drops. Calm emerges.

This isn't positive thinking. It's physiology.

## The Practice

Find a comfortable position. Sitting or lying down both work.

**The Pattern:**

1. **Inhale** through your nose for **4 counts**
2. **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for **6-8 counts**

That's it. The exhale is longer than the inhale.

### Guidelines

- Don't force the exhale. Let it be slow and natural
- If 4-8 feels like too much, try 3-6
- Breathe into your belly, not your chest
- Let your jaw be soft, shoulders dropped

### Duration

Start with 5-10 breaths. Work up to 3 minutes.

## When to Use This

- Before sleep
- After a stressful meeting or conversation
- When you notice your heart racing
- Any time you need to downshift
- As a transition between activities

## What You Might Notice

- Yawning (a sign of nervous system shift)
- Shoulders dropping
- Jaw unclenching
- Thoughts slowing
- A sense of settling

## The Deeper Layer

This practice teaches something important: you have more control over your state than you think. Not through force or will, but through the body.

The nervous system responds to the breath before it responds to thoughts. When you're activated, don't try to think your way calm. Breathe your way there.

## Variations

**4-7-8 Breath (more potent):**
- Inhale 4 counts
- Hold 7 counts
- Exhale 8 counts

**Whisper exhale:**
- Exhale through barely parted lips with a soft "haaa" sound
- The sound naturally extends the exhale

**With movement:**
- Inhale, lift shoulders to ears
- Exhale slowly, let shoulders drop
