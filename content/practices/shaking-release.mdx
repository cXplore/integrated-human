## The Practice

Animals shake after surviving a threat. It's how their nervous system discharges the activation energy of fight-or-flight. Humans have this same capacity, but we often suppress it because shaking feels "wrong" or embarrassing.

This practice gives you permission to shake. On purpose.

### Preparation

Find a space where you can move freely and won't be interrupted. Stand with feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent. Take a few breaths to arrive in your body.

### The Shaking Sequence

**Phase 1: Start the Shake (2 min)**

Begin bouncing gently on your feet, letting your knees be soft and springy. Let this bounce travel up through your body — your hips, your chest, your shoulders.

Don't force anything. Just keep bouncing and let your body find its own shake. Some people shake from the legs. Some people shake from the core. There's no wrong way.

**Phase 2: Increase & Surrender (3 min)**

Let the shaking intensify. You might:
- Shake your hands vigorously
- Let your jaw hang loose and vibrate
- Let sounds come out (sighs, grunts, anything)
- Let your head shake gently

The key: you're not doing the shaking. You're letting your body shake while you watch. Surrender control.

If emotions arise — laughter, tears, frustration — let them move through. They're part of what's releasing.

**Phase 3: Slow & Settle (2 min)**

Gradually let the shaking slow down. Don't stop abruptly.

Come to stillness. Stand with eyes closed. Notice what's different in your body. Tingling? Warmth? Spaciousness?

Take a few deep breaths. Feel your feet on the ground.

### When to Use

- After a stressful day
- When you notice your body is tense and you don't know why
- After conflict or argument (once you're alone)
- When you feel emotionally stuck
- As regular practice (some people shake daily for a few minutes)

### Tips

- Music can help. Something rhythmic without lyrics.
- Start gentle. Your body will show you how much it wants to move.
- It's normal to feel silly at first. That's just self-consciousness. It passes.
- Let sounds happen. Holding your breath or staying silent reduces the release.
- Crying, laughing, yawning — all signs that something is moving.

### The Science

Shaking discharges the "survival energy" that gets stuck in your muscles when you can't complete a fight-or-flight response (which is most of modern life). It's related to TRE (Trauma Release Exercises) developed by David Berceli, and is a core practice in somatic therapy traditions.
