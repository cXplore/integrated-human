Centering is the practice of finding your physical and psychological center of gravity—a stable place from which to act.

## How to Practice

1. **Stand with feet shoulder-width apart**, weight evenly distributed

2. **Soften your knees** slightly—not locked, not bent

3. **Find your center of gravity** (about two inches below your navel, midway between front and back). Imagine a point of light there

4. **Drop your attention** from your head down to this center

5. **Let your weight sink** into the floor through your feet

6. **Breathe into your center**—imagine breath flowing to that point of light

7. **Notice the stability** that comes from being grounded here

## Quick Version (30 seconds)

When you need centering fast:
1. Feel your feet on the floor
2. Drop your attention to your lower belly
3. Take one breath from that center
4. Act from there

## Why It Works

When stressed, attention rises to the head and we become disconnected from our bodies. Centering reverses this, activating the stable, grounded part of the nervous system.

## When to Use

- Before difficult conversations
- Before public speaking or performance
- When you feel scattered or anxious
- When knocked off balance by events
- At the start of any important activity
