## Understanding the Inner Critic

The inner critic isn't your enemy. It's a part of you that learned, usually early in life, that criticism could protect you. If you criticized yourself first, maybe others' criticism wouldn't hurt as much. If you stayed vigilant about your flaws, maybe you could fix them before anyone noticed.

The strategy made sense once. But now it's causing more harm than protection.

This practice shifts from fighting the critic to understanding it.

## The Practice

Find a quiet space. Have paper nearby if you want to write.

### Part 1: Notice the Critic (3 minutes)

Think of a recent situation where your inner critic was active. Maybe you made a mistake, received feedback, or compared yourself to someone.

Notice:
- What does the critic say? (Specific words or phrases)
- What tone of voice does it use?
- Where do you feel it in your body?
- What emotion accompanies it? (Shame, fear, anger?)

### Part 2: Create Distance (2 minutes)

You are not your inner critic. You are the one who can observe it.

From this observer position, notice:
- "There's a part of me that's being critical"
- "I can hear the critical voice, and I'm also here listening to it"

This distance is important. You have a critic; you are not the critic.

### Part 3: Get Curious (5 minutes)

From curiosity (not hostility), ask the inner critic:

- **What are you trying to protect me from?**
  (Rejection? Failure? Humiliation? Being seen as inadequate?)

- **What are you afraid would happen if you stopped?**
  (I'd become lazy? People would see the real me? I'd make terrible mistakes?)

- **How long have you been doing this job?**
  (Often since childhood)

- **What do you need me to know?**

Listen for answers. They might come as words, images, or feelings. Write them down if helpful.

### Part 4: Acknowledge (3 minutes)

Speak to the critic (internally or aloud):

"I understand you're trying to protect me from [what you discovered]. That makes sense given [past experiences]. You've been working hard for a long time."

"I don't need you to stop entirely. But I'd like to work together differently. Maybe you could share your concerns more gently. And I'll listen."

### Part 5: Check In (2 minutes)

Notice how the critic feels now. Sometimes, being understood creates a shift. The volume turns down. The tone softens.

Notice how you feel. Is there more space? More compassion for yourself?

## What You Might Discover

Common things the inner critic is protecting against:
- Abandonment (if I'm not perfect, I'll be left)
- Shame (if I see my flaws first, they hurt less)
- Failure (constant vigilance prevents mistakes)
- Rejection (be hard on yourself so others' opinions don't matter)

## Variations

**Writing Dialogue:**
- Write a conversation between you and your inner critic
- Let both voices express themselves fully

**Personification:**
- Give your inner critic a form (character, creature, figure)
- This can make it easier to dialogue with

**Thank You Practice:**
- When the critic speaks, respond: "Thank you for trying to protect me. I've got this."

## When to Use This

- When self-criticism is loud
- After perceived failures or mistakes
- When perfectionism is driving you
- When you notice shame spirals
- As ongoing practice to transform the relationship

## The Deeper Layer

The goal isn't to eliminate the inner critic. That usually backfires—you end up criticizing yourself for being self-critical.

The goal is relationship change. Understanding. Integration.

When the critic knows you're listening, when it feels acknowledged for its protective intent, it often softens. Not because you forced it, but because it finally feels heard.

The voice that seemed like an enemy becomes an ally. Not through combat, but through compassion.
