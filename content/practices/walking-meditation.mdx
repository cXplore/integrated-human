## Why Walking Works

Sitting still isn't always possible. Sometimes the body needs to move. Walking meditation meets that need while still cultivating presence.

The rhythm of walking naturally regulates the nervous system. Left-right alternation activates both brain hemispheres. Contact with the ground provides constant sensory feedback.

## The Practice

Find a space where you can walk 10-20 steps in one direction. Indoors or outdoors both work.

**Basic Walking Meditation:**

1. Stand still for a moment. Feel your feet on the ground.
2. Begin walking at half your normal pace
3. Notice the sensation of lifting one foot
4. Feel the foot moving through space
5. Notice the heel touching down, then the rest of the foot
6. Shift your weight and repeat with the other foot

When you reach the end of your path, pause. Turn slowly. Walk back.

### Where to Place Attention

Choose one anchor point:

- **Feet**: The sensation of contact with ground
- **Legs**: The muscles engaging and releasing
- **Whole body**: The gentle sway and balance
- **Breath**: How it coordinates with steps

When the mind wanders, simply return to your anchor. No judgment needed.

## Variations

**Counting Steps:**
- Count each step up to 10, then start over
- Gives the mind something simple to do

**Breath Coordination:**
- Inhale for 3-4 steps
- Exhale for 3-4 steps
- Let the rhythm emerge naturally

**Gratitude Walking:**
- With each step, silently name something you're grateful for
- Can be as simple as "feet, ground, air, body..."

**Nature Walking:**
- Practice outdoors
- Include sensory awareness: sounds, temperature, scents
- Let nature be part of the meditation

## What You Might Notice

- The urge to speed up (notice it, then choose your pace)
- How much balance is required for something "automatic"
- Thoughts becoming less sticky
- A sense of being more here
- The body relaxing as attention anchors in sensation

## When to Use This

- When sitting meditation feels impossible
- When you need to move but want to stay present
- During work breaks
- When waiting (even in small spaces)
- When feeling disconnected from your body

## The Deeper Layer

We walk thousands of steps each day on autopilot. This practice reclaims walking as an opportunity for presence.

You don't need a meditation cushion. You don't need silence. You just need the steps you're already taking.

Every walk can become a practice. The transition from your car to your office. The path to the kitchen. The route around the block.

Presence is available in the ordinary.
