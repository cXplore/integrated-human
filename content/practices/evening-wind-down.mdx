## Why Evening Transition Matters

Your nervous system doesn't have an off switch. It needs signals that the day is complete and rest is safe.

Without these signals, activation from the day carries into night. The body stays vigilant. Sleep becomes difficult. The next day starts depleted.

This practice creates a clear transition point.

## The Practice

Do this 30-60 minutes before bed. Find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down.

### Part 1: Release the Day (3 minutes)

1. Close your eyes. Take three slow breaths.
2. Mentally review your day backward:
   - What did you do this evening?
   - This afternoon?
   - This morning?
3. As you review, say silently: "That's complete."
4. Imagine setting the day down, like removing a backpack.

### Part 2: Body Scan Release (4 minutes)

Starting from your head, work down through your body:

1. **Face**: Let your jaw drop slightly. Soften your eyes. Release your forehead.
2. **Shoulders**: Let them drop away from your ears.
3. **Arms and hands**: Let them be heavy.
4. **Chest**: Allow your breath to be soft and easy.
5. **Belly**: Let it be soft. No holding.
6. **Hips and legs**: Let them sink into whatever supports you.
7. **Feet**: Feel them relax completely.

With each area, exhale and release a little more.

### Part 3: Safety Signals (3 minutes)

Choose one or more:

- **Long exhales**: Inhale for 4, exhale for 8
- **Gentle humming**: 5-6 breaths with a soft "mmm" on exhale
- **Self-touch**: Hand on heart, hand on belly
- **Orienting**: Slowly look around the room, noticing safety

End by resting in stillness for a moment.

## Variations

**Shorter Version (5 minutes):**
- Skip the day review
- Do a quick body scan
- End with 5 long exhales

**With Partner:**
- Sit back-to-back
- Breathe together
- No words needed

**Bath or Shower Version:**
- Imagine the water washing the day away
- Focus on warmth and sensation
- Let go with each exhale

## What You Might Notice

- Thoughts about tomorrow arising (acknowledge, return to body)
- Tension you didn't know you were holding
- A sigh or yawn (your body releasing)
- Feeling heavier, more settled
- Mind becoming quieter

## When to Use This

- Every evening as a routine
- After particularly stressful days
- When you know sleep will be difficult
- When carrying unfinished business into evening
- When transitioning from work mode to home mode

## The Deeper Layer

The boundary between day and night has become blurred. Screens, notifications, and always-on culture make it hard to truly stop.

This practice reinstates a boundary. It says to your nervous system: "The day is done. Nothing more is required of you. Rest is allowed."

Your body wants to wind down. It just needs permission.
