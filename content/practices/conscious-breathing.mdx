The simplest meditation: just watching your breath. No special technique—just awareness.

## How to Practice

1. **Find a comfortable position**—sitting or lying down

2. **Close your eyes** if comfortable

3. **Bring attention to your breath**. Don't change it—just notice it

4. **Observe the breath** as it is:
   - Where do you feel it most clearly?
   - What's the quality of the inhale?
   - What's the quality of the exhale?
   - What happens in the pause between?

5. **When your mind wanders**, gently return to breath. This will happen many times—each return is the practice

6. **Continue for 2-10 minutes**

## Points of Observation

- The sensation of air at your nostrils
- The rise and fall of your chest
- The expansion and contraction of your belly
- The tiny pause between breaths
- The temperature difference between inhale and exhale

## Why It Works

Breath is always happening now. By anchoring attention to breath, you're anchored to the present. The breath also reflects your nervous system state—and awareness of breath tends to naturally slow and deepen it.

## Common Challenges

**"My breath gets weird when I watch it."** Normal. Just keep watching. It usually settles.

**"I can't stop thinking."** You don't need to. Just keep returning attention to breath when you notice it's wandered.

**"This is boring."** Boredom is interesting. What happens if you stay with it?
