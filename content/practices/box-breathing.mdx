## The Practice

Box breathing creates a simple rhythm that signals safety to your nervous system. Four equal parts, like drawing a square with your breath.

### Instructions

Find a comfortable position. You can sit, stand, or lie down.

**The Pattern:**

1. **Inhale** slowly through your nose for **4 counts**
2. **Hold** your breath for **4 counts** (not straining, just pausing)
3. **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for **4 counts**
4. **Hold** empty for **4 counts**

Repeat for 3-5 rounds, or until you feel your body settling.

### Tips

- If 4 counts feels too long, start with 3. The equality matters more than the length.
- Keep your shoulders relaxed. Notice if they're creeping up.
- Focus on the space between breaths — this is where the nervous system resets.

### When to Use

- Before a difficult conversation
- When you notice anxiety building
- To transition between activities
- Before sleep
- Anytime you feel your mind racing

### The Science

The extended exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest). The holds create what's called "intermittent hypoxia" which, in small doses, improves stress resilience. The rhythmic nature gives your mind something to focus on, interrupting rumination loops.
