Humans evolved in nature, and our nervous systems still respond to it. Intentional nature connection provides restoration that's hard to find elsewhere.

## How to Practice

### The Basic Practice

Spend 20+ minutes in a natural setting with these guidelines:
- Leave devices behind or off
- No agenda or destination
- Move at whatever pace feels right
- Let your attention be drawn naturally

### Deepening Connection

**Ground**: If possible, let bare feet touch earth, grass, or sand

**Receive**: Let nature come to you rather than seeking it—sounds, smells, sights, sensations

**Soften your gaze**: Instead of focused looking, let your peripheral vision expand

**Breathe with awareness**: Notice the quality of outdoor air

**Touch**: Make contact with natural elements—tree bark, stones, leaves, water

**Sit**: Find a spot and stay there for 10+ minutes, just being present

### Urban Adaptation

No wilderness? Nature is everywhere:
- Parks, even small ones
- Trees along streets
- Sky and clouds
- Birds and insects
- Water features
- Houseplants

## Why It Works

Nature activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reduces cortisol, and engages the brain's resting networks. It provides perspective—reminder that you're part of something larger, that life cycles, that much goes on without human involvement.

## The Minimum Effective Dose

Research suggests even 20 minutes of nature exposure produces measurable benefits. Even looking at natural scenes or sounds helps, though real immersion is more powerful.

## When to Use

- When feeling stressed or overwhelmed
- After intense mental work
- When seeking perspective
- As regular maintenance (daily is ideal)
