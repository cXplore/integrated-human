Mindful eating brings the same quality of attention you'd use in meditation to the act of eating.

## How to Practice

### Full Practice (for learning)

Choose one meal or snack:

1. **Before eating**
   - Pause and take a breath
   - Notice your hunger level (1-10)
   - Look at your food—colors, shapes, textures
   - Notice any emotions or thoughts about eating

2. **First bite**
   - Take a small bite
   - Put down utensil/food
   - Close your eyes if helpful
   - Notice texture, temperature, flavor
   - Chew thoroughly before swallowing

3. **Continue eating**
   - Take small bites
   - Pause between bites
   - Notice when flavors change
   - Notice when hunger begins to diminish

4. **Check in mid-meal**
   - How satisfied are you now?
   - What does your body want?

5. **End consciously**
   - Notice when you've had enough
   - Stop when satisfied, not stuffed

### Daily Practice

Apply these elements without making every meal a formal practice:
- Pause before eating
- Put the phone away
- Eat sitting down
- Taste the first three bites fully
- Check satisfaction mid-meal

## Why It Works

When we eat on autopilot, we often eat past fullness, miss enjoyment, and disconnect from what our body actually needs. Mindful eating restores the feedback loops between eating, satisfaction, and nourishment.

## What You Might Notice

- You get satisfied with less food
- Some foods are more satisfying than others
- You eat for reasons beyond hunger
- Flavors are more vivid than you realized
