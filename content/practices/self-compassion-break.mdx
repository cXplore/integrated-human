## The Practice

When you're suffering — especially when you're being hard on yourself — this three-part practice creates space for compassion. It's based on Kristin Neff's research showing that self-compassion is more effective than self-esteem for psychological wellbeing.

### When to Use

Use this when you notice:
- Harsh self-criticism
- Shame spiraling
- Beating yourself up over a mistake
- Comparing yourself negatively to others
- Feeling like a failure

### The Three Steps

**Step 1: Mindfulness — Acknowledge the Suffering**

Place your hand on your heart (or wherever feels soothing). Say to yourself:

*"This is a moment of suffering."*

Or: *"This hurts."* Or: *"I'm struggling right now."*

Don't minimize it. Don't dramatize it. Just name it.

**Step 2: Common Humanity — Remember You're Not Alone**

*"Suffering is part of being human."*

Or: *"Other people feel this way too."* Or: *"I'm not alone in this."*

This counters the isolation that suffering creates — the feeling that you're uniquely broken or that everyone else has it together.

**Step 3: Kindness — Offer Yourself Care**

*"May I be kind to myself."*

Or choose what you need to hear:
- *"May I give myself the compassion I need."*
- *"May I accept myself as I am."*
- *"May I be patient with myself."*
- *"May I forgive myself."*

If it feels forced, try asking: *"What would I say to a good friend going through this?"* Then say that to yourself.

### The Full Version

Put it together:

*"This is a moment of suffering.* (hand on heart)
*Suffering is part of being human.*
*May I be kind to myself in this moment."*

Breathe. Let it land.

### Tips

- Physical touch helps. Hand on heart, hand on cheek, arms around yourself — whatever feels soothing.
- The words don't have to be exact. Find language that resonates with you.
- This isn't about feeling better immediately. It's about changing your relationship to difficulty.
- You can do this silently in any situation — in a meeting, after a hard conversation, in bed at night.

### Common Resistance

"But I deserve to feel bad. I messed up."

Self-compassion isn't saying what you did was okay. It's saying you're worthy of kindness regardless. Humans make mistakes. You're human. That's actually the point.

"This feels fake/cheesy."

Fair. Most of us aren't practiced at being kind to ourselves. Start with: *"May I be willing to try this."* Willingness counts.
