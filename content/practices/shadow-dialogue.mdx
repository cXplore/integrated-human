## The Practice

Your shadow contains parts of yourself you've rejected, denied, or hidden. These parts don't disappear — they operate from the unconscious, often running your life in ways you don't see. This practice creates a conscious relationship with them.

### Preparation

You'll need 15-20 minutes of uninterrupted time and something to write with. A journal works best, but any paper will do.

Settle into your body. Take a few breaths. This works better when you're grounded, not spinning in your head.

### Step 1: Identify the Shadow Part

Choose one of these entry points:

**Through reaction:** Think of someone who really bothers you. What quality in them triggers you? (Arrogance? Weakness? Selfishness?) That quality likely exists in your shadow.

**Through judgment:** What do you harshly criticize in yourself? What would you never want people to know about you?

**Through pattern:** What keeps happening in your life that you can't seem to change? What part of you might be creating it?

Name the quality or part. ("My arrogance." "The part of me that gives up." "My rage.")

### Step 2: Give It a Voice

Write at the top of your page: *"To the [name of part]..."*

Now write a few lines directly to this part. How do you feel about it? What do you want to say to it? Don't censor yourself.

Example: *"To my selfishness — I hate you. You make me feel like a bad person. You're why I can't have close relationships. I wish you didn't exist."*

### Step 3: Let It Respond

This is where it gets interesting.

Switch to writing *from* the shadow part. Give it a voice. Let it respond to what you just wrote. What does it want to say?

Start with: *"I..."* and let it flow. Don't edit. Don't try to be nice or wise. Let the part speak as itself.

Example: *"I'm not selfishness. I'm the part of you that knows your needs matter. You've been taught that wanting things for yourself is bad. But I'm the reason you're still alive. I'm the part that says 'no' when you've given too much..."*

### Step 4: Dialogue

Continue the conversation. You can ask questions:
- Why are you here?
- What are you protecting me from?
- What do you need?
- What happens if I keep rejecting you?

Let the part answer. This isn't making things up — it's listening to what's already there.

### Step 5: Close

End by acknowledging the part, even if you don't fully understand or accept it yet.

*"I see that you're here. I'm willing to get to know you better."*

### Important Notes

- This can bring up strong emotions. That's normal. It means you're touching something real.
- You don't have to "fix" anything. The goal is relationship, not resolution.
- Some shadow parts are protective. They may be harsh on the surface but serving a function underneath.
- If something feels too intense, stop. Come back to it with support if needed.

### When to Use

- When you notice yourself judging someone harshly
- When you keep repeating a pattern you don't understand
- When you feel shame about a part of yourself
- As regular practice (weekly shadow work builds integration over time)

*The goal isn't to become your shadow. It's to stop being controlled by what you refuse to see.*
