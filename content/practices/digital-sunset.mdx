The blue light from screens suppresses melatonin and keeps your brain in alert mode. A digital sunset creates space for your nervous system to prepare for sleep.

## How to Practice

### Set Your Sunset Time

Choose a time 60-90 minutes before your target bedtime. At this time, screens stop.

**What counts as screens:**
- Phone
- Computer
- Tablet
- TV
- E-readers with backlight

### Create the Boundary

1. Set an alarm or reminder for your digital sunset
2. When it goes off, put devices in a designated spot
3. Switch to screenless activities

### What to Do Instead

**Relaxing activities:**
- Reading (paper books or e-ink devices)
- Journaling
- Gentle stretching
- Conversation
- Puzzles or low-key games
- Taking a bath
- Preparing for tomorrow
- Listening to calm music or audiobooks

### Make It Automatic

- Charge devices outside the bedroom
- Use phone's bedtime mode for automatic dimming
- Have a book visible and ready
- Create a consistent wind-down routine

## Why It Works

Screens stimulate the brain and suppress melatonin, making sleep onset harder and sleep quality worse. The digital sunset lets your circadian system do its job—preparing your body for restorative sleep.

## Common Challenges

**FOMO**: Nothing happens after your sunset that can't wait until morning.

**"I need my phone for alarm"**: Buy a $10 alarm clock.

**"I use it for audiobooks"**: Use a dedicated player, or put phone in airplane mode across the room.
