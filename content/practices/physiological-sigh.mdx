## The Practice

This is what your body does naturally when you're crying and trying to calm down, or when you've just finished an intense cry. Researchers at Stanford found that doing it intentionally is the fastest way to shift from stress to calm.

### Instructions

**One Breath:**

1. **Inhale** through your nose
2. At the top, **take a second small inhale** (topping off your lungs)
3. **Long, slow exhale** through your mouth

That's it. One cycle.

For stronger effect, repeat 2-3 times.

### The Details

The double inhale fully inflates the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli). When these are fully expanded, they signal your heart via the vagus nerve to slow down. The long exhale then activates the parasympathetic "rest" response.

You've done this unconsciously thousands of times — after sobbing, after a scare, after a big effort. Now you can do it on purpose.

### When to Use

- Right before something stressful (presentation, difficult conversation)
- When you notice anger rising
- After receiving upsetting news
- During or after conflict
- Anytime you need to shift quickly

### Tips

- Make the second inhale a real "sip" of air, not just a pause
- The exhale should be notably longer than the inhales combined
- You can do this subtly — no one needs to notice
- Works even better with mouth slightly open on exhale (soft "hahhh")
