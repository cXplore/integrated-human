Writing a heartfelt letter of gratitude deepens your own sense of appreciation while potentially strengthening an important relationship.

## How to Practice

1. **Choose someone** who has made a positive difference in your life—a friend, family member, teacher, mentor, or even someone you've lost touch with

2. **Write the letter** by hand if possible. Include:
   - What they did that impacted you
   - How it made you feel at the time
   - How it continues to affect your life
   - What their support has meant to you

3. **Be specific.** General gratitude is nice; specific details are powerful

4. **Consider delivering it.** Reading it aloud to the person multiplies the positive effects for both of you

## Why It Works

Expressing gratitude shifts your attention toward what's working in your life and relationships. The act of writing crystallizes feelings that often go unspoken.

## Variations

- Write to someone who is no longer alive
- Write to a younger version of yourself
- Write to someone you'll never send it to (the benefits still happen)

## When to Use

- When you want to deepen a relationship
- When you're feeling disconnected from others
- As a regular gratitude practice (monthly or quarterly)
