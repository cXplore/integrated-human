Multitasking is a myth—the brain doesn't do two things at once, it rapidly switches, losing efficiency each time. Single-tasking reclaims focus.

## How to Practice

### The Basic Practice

Choose one activity. Do only that activity until it's complete or time is up.

**While single-tasking:**
- No phone checking
- No browser tab switching
- No interrupting yourself
- If a thought comes about something else, note it and return to the task

### The Rules

1. **Define what you're doing** before you start
2. **Set a time boundary** if needed (25-50 minutes works well)
3. **Remove distractions** proactively (phone in another room, tabs closed)
4. **When you notice multitasking urge**, pause, breathe, return

### Single-Task Anything

Apply this to:
- Work tasks
- Conversations (just listen)
- Eating (just eat)
- Walking (just walk)
- Reading (just read)

## Why It Works

Every time you switch tasks, there's a cognitive cost—residual attention stays on the previous task. Single-tasking eliminates this switching cost and allows deep engagement, which is both more productive and more satisfying.

## The Challenge

Track how long you can single-task before the urge to switch becomes overwhelming. Most people are surprised how short this is initially. With practice, duration extends.

## When to Use

- During important or creative work
- In conversations you care about
- Anytime you want to fully experience what you're doing
- As a regular practice to strengthen focus
