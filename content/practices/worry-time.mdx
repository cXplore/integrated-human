Instead of worrying throughout the day, give your worries a specific appointment. This surprisingly effective technique contains anxiety without suppressing it.

## How to Practice

### Set Up

1. **Schedule 15-20 minutes** at the same time daily (not right before bed)
2. **Choose a dedicated spot**—a specific chair or location
3. **Have paper ready** for writing

### During Worry Time

1. **Sit in your worry spot**
2. **Let yourself worry fully**—don't resist any worry that arises
3. **Write down your worries** as they come
4. **For each worry, ask**:
   - Is this something I can control?
   - If yes: What's one action I could take?
   - If no: Can I accept that this is out of my hands?
5. **When time is up**, close the notebook and leave the spot

### Outside Worry Time

When worries arise during the day:
1. Notice the worry
2. Write it down briefly (one line)
3. Tell yourself: "I'll think about this during worry time"
4. Return attention to the present

## Why It Works

Worrying feels urgent—like we need to address it NOW. But worry postponed is often worry diminished. By giving anxiety a contained space, you prove to yourself that worries can wait, and that they're manageable when given proper attention.

## Tips

- Keep the appointment even if you feel fine—consistency builds the habit
- If you run out of worries before time is up, that's great information
- The spot matters—it creates a physical container for worry
