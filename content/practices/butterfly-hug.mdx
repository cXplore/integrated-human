The Butterfly Hug combines gentle self-touch with bilateral stimulation to activate your body's self-soothing systems.

## How to Practice

1. Cross your arms over your chest, with your hands resting on your upper arms or shoulders
2. Interlock your thumbs to create the "butterfly" shape
3. Close your eyes if comfortable
4. Alternate tapping your hands slowly—left, right, left, right
5. Breathe naturally while continuing the rhythm
6. Continue for 2-5 minutes

## Why It Works

Bilateral stimulation (alternating left-right movement) engages both hemispheres of the brain and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. The self-touch provides comforting sensory input.

## When to Use

- During moments of anxiety or overwhelm
- When processing difficult emotions
- Before sleep to calm the nervous system
- Anytime you need gentle self-soothing
