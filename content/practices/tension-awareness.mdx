We hold tension without knowing it—in shoulders, jaw, belly, hands. This practice brings awareness to these patterns so you can release them.

## How to Practice

### The Scan

Several times daily, scan your body for tension:

**Common tension spots:**
- Jaw (clenched or tight?)
- Tongue (pressed against roof of mouth?)
- Shoulders (raised toward ears?)
- Hands (making fists?)
- Belly (holding tight?)
- Lower back (compressed?)
- Feet (gripping the floor?)

### The Release

When you notice tension:
1. Don't force it to relax—just notice it fully
2. Take a breath
3. On the exhale, invite the area to soften
4. Notice any change

### Building the Habit

Set triggers to remind you to scan:
- Every time you check your phone
- Before meals
- At stoplights
- When you sit down
- When you stand up

## Why It Works

Chronic tension wastes energy, compresses the body, and sends signals of threat to the nervous system. Simply bringing awareness to tension often allows it to release naturally. Over time, you'll catch tension earlier and release it more quickly.

## Pattern Recognition

After a week of practice, you'll likely notice patterns:
- Where you consistently hold tension
- What activities or thoughts trigger it
- What helps it release

This information helps you address root causes, not just symptoms.
