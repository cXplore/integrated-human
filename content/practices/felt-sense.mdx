The felt sense is your body's holistic knowing about a situation—a physical sensation that contains implicit meaning. Focusing, developed by Eugene Gendlin, is the practice of attending to this knowing.

## How to Practice

### 1. Clearing a Space

- Sit quietly and close your eyes
- Ask: "How am I right now? What's between me and feeling fine?"
- Let whatever comes arise, but don't dive into it
- Acknowledge each thing ("Yes, that's there") and set it aside for now
- Keep going until you feel some clear space

### 2. Choose Something to Focus On

Select one of the things that came up, or a situation you want to understand better.

### 3. Find the Felt Sense

- Ask: "What does this whole thing feel like in my body?"
- Wait for a physical sensation to form
- It's often vague at first—somewhere in throat, chest, or belly
- Stay with it without trying to understand or change it

### 4. Find a Handle

- Let a word, phrase, or image arise that matches the quality of the felt sense
- "It's like... tight? heavy? stuck?"
- Check: Does this handle match the felt sense?

### 5. Resonate

- Go back and forth between the handle and the felt sense
- Adjust the handle until it matches perfectly
- When it fits, there's often a slight release or shift

### 6. Ask

- Ask the felt sense: "What makes this so [handle]?"
- Or: "What does this need?"
- Wait. Let the answer come from the body, not the thinking mind

### 7. Receive

- Whatever comes, receive it without judgment
- There may be a felt shift—a release, an "ahh"
- Even small shifts are significant

## Why It Works

The body holds more information than the conscious mind can access. The felt sense is a direct line to this bodily knowing, which often contains insight that thinking alone can't reach.

## Important Notes

- This practice takes time to develop—be patient
- Start with small issues before tackling major ones
- A focusing partner or guide can help learning
- Read Gendlin's "Focusing" for full instruction
