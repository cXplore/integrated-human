## Why This Works

Some things can't be said directly. The person isn't available, isn't safe, or is no longer living. But the unexpressed stays in the body. It takes up space. It keeps cycling.

Writing an unsent letter gives these words somewhere to go. The expression is what heals, not the delivery.

## The Practice

Choose someone you have unfinished business with. This could be:
- Someone who hurt you
- Someone you hurt
- Someone who died before you could say something
- A younger version of yourself
- A relationship that ended without closure

**Write the letter.**

Begin with "Dear [name]" and write whatever needs to be said.

### Guidelines

- Write by hand if possible (deeper processing)
- Don't censor yourself
- Include all emotions, even contradictory ones
- Say the things you "shouldn't" say
- Write until you feel complete (for now)
- This letter will never be sent

## What to Write

Whatever needs to be expressed:

- What they did and how it affected you
- What you wish had happened
- What you needed and didn't get
- Your anger, your grief, your love
- Questions you need answered (you can answer them yourself)
- What you're letting go of
- What you're choosing to remember

## After Writing

Choose what feels right:

- **Read it aloud** to yourself or an empty chair
- **Burn it** as a release ritual
- **Tear it up** and throw it away
- **Keep it** in a private place
- **Bury it** symbolically

The physical act of release can be powerful. Choose based on what the letter needs.

## What You Might Experience

**During writing:**
- Tears, anger, relief
- Memories surfacing
- Surprising things emerging
- Exhaustion or release

**After:**
- Feeling lighter
- Needing rest
- A sense of completion
- Sometimes, renewed grief (this is part of processing)

## Variations

**Response Letter:**
- After writing your letter, write a response as if from the other person
- Write what you needed to hear
- This can be surprisingly healing

**Letter to Yourself:**
- Write to your younger self who went through something hard
- Offer the compassion and understanding you needed then

**Gratitude Letter:**
- Write to someone who helped you
- Include specific impacts they had
- You might choose to send this one

**Forgiveness Letter:**
- Write about what you're forgiving (you or them)
- Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning
- It means releasing yourself from carrying it

## When to Use This

- When you're stuck on something from the past
- After a relationship ends without closure
- When grieving someone who died
- When processing old wounds in therapy
- When resentment is building
- When you need to forgive but can't do it directly

## The Deeper Layer

Some conversations can't happen in reality. The person won't hear you, won't change, won't validate. Or they're gone.

But you can still have the conversation. The unsent letter lets you say everything, feel everything, and release what you've been carrying.

The healing isn't in their response. It's in your expression.

Write the letter. Then let it go.
