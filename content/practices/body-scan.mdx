## The Practice

Many of us live from the neck up — we know what we're thinking but not what we're feeling in our bodies. The body scan is a practice of systematically moving attention through the body, noticing what's there without trying to change it.

This simple practice builds body awareness, releases unconscious tension, and creates the foundation for more advanced somatic work. It's also one of the best ways to interrupt racing thoughts by giving the mind something specific to do.

### Preparation

Lie down or sit comfortably. If lying down, let your arms rest by your sides, palms up or down, whatever feels natural.

Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths, letting your body settle into the surface beneath you.

### The Practice

Move your attention slowly through your body. At each region, simply notice what's there. Don't try to relax, don't try to change anything — just notice.

**Feet**
Bring your attention to your feet. Notice the soles, the toes, the tops of the feet. Is there temperature? Tingling? Numbness? Tension? Just notice.

**Lower Legs**
Move up to the ankles, calves, and shins. What sensations are here? Heaviness? Lightness? Aching? Nothing at all? All of it is fine.

**Upper Legs**
Thighs, front and back. Hips. Notice the weight of your legs against the surface beneath you.

**Pelvis**
The lower belly, the hips, the lower back. This area often holds tension without us knowing. Just notice what's there.

**Belly**
The soft belly. Rising and falling with breath. Many people habitually hold tension here. You don't have to release it — just notice if it's there.

**Chest**
The ribcage, the heart space. Is the chest open or contracted? Is breathing easy or restricted? Just notice.

**Back**
The entire back, from lower back up through middle back to upper back. Where does the body touch the surface? Where is there space?

**Shoulders**
Notice if they're up near the ears or relaxed down. Notice if one feels different from the other.

**Arms and Hands**
Upper arms, elbows, forearms, wrists, palms, fingers. Each finger. Tingling? Temperature? Weight?

**Neck and Throat**
The neck, holding the weight of the head. The throat, often a place of unexpressed things. Just notice.

**Face**
Jaw (usually holding tension), cheeks, around the eyes, forehead, scalp. Let your attention rest on each area for a few breaths.

**Whole Body**
Finally, try to sense the whole body at once. Lying here, breathing. A unified field of sensation.

### Variations

**Quick Version (5 minutes)**
Instead of region by region, simply divide the body into three parts: lower body (feet to hips), torso (belly, chest, back), and upper body (shoulders, arms, neck, head). Spend about a minute on each.

**Problem Area Focus**
If you know you hold tension in a specific area (jaw, shoulders, lower back), spend extra time there. Not trying to fix it — just bringing attention and breath.

**Sleep Version**
Do the body scan in bed before sleep, but don't go back up. Start at the head and move down to the feet. Often you'll fall asleep before reaching the end.

### What You Might Notice

- Areas of tension you didn't know were there
- Asymmetry (one side feeling different from the other)
- Emotions that arise when you contact certain areas
- Parts of the body that feel "blank" or hard to sense
- Relaxation happening naturally just from attention

All of this is normal and useful information.

### Common Challenges

**"I can't feel anything in some areas."**
That's common, especially if you're new to this or have been disconnected from your body. The lack of sensation *is* the sensation. Just note "not much sensation here" and move on. Sensitivity develops with practice.

**"I keep falling asleep."**
If you're tired, you might need sleep more than meditation. Otherwise, try practicing sitting up, or keep your eyes slightly open.

**"My attention keeps wandering."**
Of course it does. That's what minds do. When you notice you've wandered, gently return to wherever you left off. The noticing is the practice.

### When to Use

- As a daily practice to maintain body connection
- Before bed to release the day
- When you feel anxious or overwhelmed
- When you've been in your head too long
- Before other body-based practices

### The Deeper Point

Most of us treat the body as a vehicle for the mind — something that carries our head around. The body scan reverses this, using the mind to serve the body. Over time, it creates a collaborative relationship between the two.

What you practice noticing, you get better at noticing. And what you can notice, you can work with.
