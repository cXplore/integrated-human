We tend to fuse with our thoughts—treating them as facts and ourselves. Defusion creates space between you and your thoughts.

## How to Practice

### Basic Defusion Techniques

**"I'm having the thought that..."**
Instead of: "I'm not good enough"
Say: "I'm having the thought that I'm not good enough"

**Sing the thought**
Take a troubling thought and sing it to "Happy Birthday" or another tune. Notice what happens.

**Say it in a funny voice**
Repeat the thought in a cartoon character voice. The content is the same; the grip loosens.

**Thank your mind**
"Thanks, mind, for that thought. You're really looking out for me."

**Name the story**
"Ah, there's the 'I'm going to fail' story again."

### The Leaves on a Stream

1. Sit comfortably and imagine a stream flowing
2. When a thought arises, place it on a leaf
3. Watch the leaf float downstream
4. Don't push leaves faster or stop them—just observe
5. When you get caught in a thought, notice that, and place that thought on a leaf too

## Why It Works

Defusion doesn't change thought content—it changes your relationship to thoughts. When you see thoughts as passing mental events rather than truth or commands, they have less power over your behavior.

## What Defusion Isn't

- It's not suppressing thoughts
- It's not arguing with thoughts
- It's not positive thinking
- It's not believing thoughts are false

It's simply seeing thoughts as thoughts—mental events that come and go, not facts you must obey.
