## The Practice

Most people start their day in reaction mode — checking the phone, jumping into tasks, responding to whatever demands attention first. By the time they pause to think about what matters, half the day is gone.

This practice takes five minutes before the day starts. It's not about productivity hacks or optimizing your morning. It's about choosing how you want to meet the day before the day happens to you.

### When to Use

Before you check your phone. Before you open your laptop. Before you engage with anyone else's agenda. Ideally right after waking, but anytime before the day "starts" works.

### The Practice

Sit somewhere quiet with something to write with. Take three deep breaths.

**1. Arrive (30 seconds)**

Notice that you're here, at the beginning of a new day. Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow isn't here yet. This is the only day you need to think about.

**2. Check In (1 minute)**

Without judgment, notice: How am I arriving at this day?

- What's my energy level?
- What's my mood?
- What's lingering from yesterday?
- What am I carrying that isn't mine to carry?

Don't try to fix anything. Just notice.

**3. Choose an Intention (2 minutes)**

Ask yourself: *What's one way I want to show up today?*

This isn't a to-do item. It's a quality of presence. Examples:

- *Today I practice patience.*
- *Today I speak truth.*
- *Today I stay grounded.*
- *Today I choose courage over comfort.*
- *Today I remember what matters.*
- *Today I respond instead of react.*
- *Today I let things be imperfect.*

Write it down. Keep it simple. One intention is enough.

**4. Envision (1 minute)**

Briefly imagine moving through your day with this intention. What might be different? Where might it be tested? How might you remember?

You don't need to plan everything. Just let the intention settle into your body.

**5. Close (30 seconds)**

Take one more breath. Feel your feet on the ground. You're ready.

### Making It Stick

- Write your intention somewhere you'll see it (phone background, sticky note, hand)
- Set one reminder to check in mid-day: "Am I living my intention?"
- At night, briefly review: "How did I do?" No judgment — just noticing

### Variations

**No Writing**
If you can't write, do this as a mental practice. Close your eyes and go through the same steps.

**Walking Version**
Do this during a short morning walk. Ask the questions as you walk. Let the intention arise from movement.

**Paired Intention**
Choose one intention for yourself (how you want to be) and one for your interactions (how you want to treat others).

### Common Challenges

**"My intention falls apart by 10 AM."**
That's normal. The practice isn't about perfect execution — it's about having a compass. When you notice you've drifted, you can return. Without the intention, you wouldn't even notice the drift.

**"I don't know what intention to set."**
Start with what's challenging right now. If you've been reactive, set intention around responding. If you've been scattered, set intention around presence. If you've been harsh with yourself, set intention around kindness.

**"This feels forced."**
At first, it is. You're building a new habit. It becomes natural over time. Trust the process.

### The Deeper Point

Days don't just happen — they're created by the thousand small choices we make. Most of those choices are unconscious, driven by habit and reaction. Setting an intention makes one of those choices conscious. It's a small act, but small acts compound.

You're not trying to control the day. You're trying to meet it with intention instead of accident.
