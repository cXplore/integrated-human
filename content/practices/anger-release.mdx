## The Practice

Anger is information and energy. When you suppress it, it goes underground — into depression, resentment, passive aggression, or physical symptoms. When you act it out destructively, you create damage. This practice creates a container for the energy to move through you without either extreme.

### Important First

This practice involves physical movement and vocal expression. You'll need:
- Privacy (or at least tolerance from those nearby)
- Space to move
- Something soft to hit if you choose that option (pillow, mattress)
- 5-10 minutes without interruption

If you have injuries or physical limitations, adapt accordingly.

### Step 1: Ground and Contain

Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Feel your feet on the ground.

Take three deep breaths. You're not trying to calm down — you're creating a container for what's about to move.

Set an intention: *"I'm going to feel this fully and let it move through me. I'm not going to hurt myself or anyone else."*

### Step 2: Access the Anger

Think about what's making you angry. Don't analyze it — let yourself *feel* it. Where is it in your body? Chest? Jaw? Fists? Belly?

Let your body respond. Your hands might clench. Your jaw might tighten. Your breathing might change. Let it.

### Step 3: Move It

Choose what feels right:

**Push Against a Wall**
Place your palms flat against a wall, lean in, and push. Push hard. Make sound if it wants to come — growling, yelling, whatever emerges. Push until you feel the energy start to shift.

**Hit Something Soft**
Grab a pillow or kneel by your bed. Hit it. Use your fists, use open hands, use whatever feels right. Don't hold back. Make sound. Let the words come if they want to: *"No!"* *"Stop!"* *"I'm angry!"*

**Stomp and Yell**
Stand and stomp your feet. Hard. Let sound come. Growl. Yell. Roar. Move your arms. Take up space. Be loud. Be big.

**Twist a Towel**
Hold a towel with both hands and wring it as hard as you can, like you're wringing out water. Let the tension move through your arms and hands.

### Step 4: Let It Complete

Keep going until you feel a shift. You'll know — the intensity will peak and then start to move. The energy will change from contracted to released.

This might take two minutes or ten. Stay with it.

### Step 5: Ground and Settle

When the energy has moved, slow down. Take deep breaths. Feel your feet.

Shake out your hands. Roll your shoulders. Let your body settle.

Notice what's different now. The anger might still be there, but it's probably not stuck anymore.

### After

Drink water. Move gently. Journal if it helps.

You might feel tired, relieved, clearer, or something else entirely. All of it is normal.

The situation that angered you probably still needs to be addressed. But now you can think about it without the energy running you.

### When to Use

- When anger is building and you need to discharge it
- Before a difficult conversation (so the anger doesn't hijack you)
- When you notice resentment accumulating
- When you've been too nice and need to reconnect with your "no"
- As regular practice if you tend to suppress anger

### A Note on Anger

Anger is a healthy emotion. It tells you something is wrong — a boundary has been crossed, an injustice has occurred, something needs to change. The problem isn't the anger. The problem is what we do with it.

Suppression makes it fester. Acting out causes harm. This practice offers a third path: feel it fully, let it move, then respond consciously.
