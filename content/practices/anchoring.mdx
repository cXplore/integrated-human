Anchoring links a physical gesture with an emotional state, allowing you to access that state when you need it.

## How to Practice

### Creating Your Anchor

1. **Choose a state** you want to access (calm, confident, focused, etc.)

2. **Choose a physical anchor**—a discrete gesture you can do anywhere:
   - Pressing thumb and finger together
   - Touching a specific spot on your wrist
   - Making a fist

3. **Recall a time** when you strongly felt this state. Really step into the memory—see what you saw, hear what you heard, feel what you felt

4. **At the peak of the feeling**, activate your anchor (make the gesture)

5. **Hold the anchor** for 5-10 seconds while the feeling is strong

6. **Release and break state** (think of something neutral)

7. **Repeat 3-5 times** with different memories of the same state

### Firing Your Anchor

When you need to access the state:
1. Make the gesture exactly as you created it
2. Notice the state beginning to shift
3. Hold for a few seconds
4. The feeling may be subtle at first—it strengthens with use

## Why It Works

This is classical conditioning applied deliberately. You're creating an association between a stimulus (the gesture) and a response (the emotional state).

## Tips for Success

- Use the same precise gesture each time
- Create the anchor when the feeling is at its peak, not fading
- "Stack" the anchor with multiple memories for stronger effect
- Fire the anchor regularly to keep it strong
