## Why Humming Works

The vagus nerve runs through your throat. When you hum, the vibration directly stimulates this nerve, triggering your parasympathetic response.

This is why humming feels naturally soothing. Why mothers hum to babies. Why monks chant. Your body knows what it needs.

## The Practice

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes if that feels right.

**Basic Humming:**

1. Take a full breath in through your nose
2. Hum on the exhale - a simple "mmmmm" sound
3. Feel the vibration in your throat, face, and chest
4. When the breath is done, pause briefly
5. Inhale again and repeat

Continue for 5 minutes, or as long as feels good.

### Finding Your Note

- Don't worry about pitch or musicality
- Find a note that feels comfortable in your throat
- The "right" note creates more vibration you can feel
- Lower notes tend to be more grounding
- Higher notes tend to be more energizing

## Variations

**Bee Breath (Bhramari):**
- Cover your ears with your thumbs
- Rest fingers over closed eyes
- Hum on the exhale
- The sound becomes internal, deeper

**Location Focus:**
- Hum and imagine the vibration in your heart
- Hum and feel it in your belly
- Hum and let it fill your whole body

**Extended Exhale Hum:**
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hum for 8+ counts
- Combines vagal stimulation with extended exhale

## What You Might Notice

- Tingling in face, lips, or throat
- A sense of calm spreading through your body
- Thoughts quieting
- Jaw and throat relaxing
- Feeling more present

## When to Use This

- When you feel disconnected from your body
- Before difficult conversations
- When anxiety is building
- As a transition between activities
- When you need to self-soothe and can't be touched

## The Deeper Layer

You have a built-in regulation tool that goes everywhere with you. Your voice. When you're dysregulated and alone, you can hum yourself back to center.

This isn't weakness. It's wisdom. Using what you have.

Children naturally hum and make sounds when stressed. Somewhere we learned to stop. This practice is remembering what your body already knows.
