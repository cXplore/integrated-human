## The Practice

Loving-kindness (metta in Pali) is the practice of deliberately generating wishes for wellbeing — first for yourself, then extending outward to others. Unlike some meditation practices that focus on awareness alone, this one is about actively cultivating a specific quality: unconditional friendliness toward all beings, including yourself.

Research shows it reduces self-criticism, increases positive emotions, improves social connection, and even affects physical markers of inflammation. But that's not why you do it. You do it because it changes how you relate to being human.

### Preparation

Find a comfortable seat. You can sit on a cushion, chair, or lie down if needed.

Close your eyes or let your gaze soften. Take a few deep breaths, letting your body settle.

Place a hand on your heart if that helps you connect.

### The Phrases

Traditional loving-kindness uses phrases like:

*May I be happy.*
*May I be healthy.*
*May I be safe.*
*May I live with ease.*

You can use these, or adapt them to language that resonates with you:

*May I be at peace.*
*May I be free from suffering.*
*May I know that I am enough.*
*May I be kind to myself.*

The words matter less than the intention behind them.

### The Practice

**1. Start With Yourself**

Begin by directing these wishes toward yourself.

Silently repeat: *"May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I live with ease."*

This is often the hardest part. If you encounter resistance, that's information. You might adapt the phrase: *"May I be willing to be happy."* Or simply notice the resistance without forcing.

Spend 3-5 minutes here. Let the words sink in. Don't worry if you don't feel anything — you're planting seeds.

**2. Someone You Love**

Bring to mind someone you naturally feel warmth toward. A friend, family member, teacher, or pet. Someone whose face makes you smile.

Picture them clearly. Then offer them the phrases:

*"May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease."*

Feel whatever warmth arises. Let it be easy.

**3. A Neutral Person**

This is where it gets interesting.

Think of someone you neither like nor dislike — a stranger you've seen, a neighbor you don't know, someone in the background of your life.

Picture them as a full human being with their own hopes and struggles. Then offer:

*"May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease."*

Notice what happens when you extend warmth to someone you have no investment in.

**4. A Difficult Person**

Now bring to mind someone you have conflict with. Start with someone mildly difficult, not the person who's hurt you most.

This isn't about excusing their behavior or pretending you like them. It's about recognizing that they too want to be happy, and that wishing them suffering doesn't help you.

*"May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease."*

If this feels impossible, you can modify: *"To whatever degree I'm able, may I wish you well."* Or start with: *"May you find what you're looking for so you stop hurting others."*

**5. All Beings**

Finally, extend outward to include all beings everywhere:

*"May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings be safe. May all beings live with ease."*

Include everyone — those you know, those you don't, those suffering, those thriving, those you agree with, those you don't. All beings.

**6. Rest**

Release the phrases. Sit quietly for a moment. Notice what you feel.

### Common Challenges

**"I feel nothing."**
That's normal, especially at first. The practice works even when you don't feel it. Think of it like watering a plant — you don't see immediate results, but the roots are drinking.

**"I can't do self-compassion."**
This is common and important. If you struggle with the self-directed phrases, spend more time there, not less. Or start with directing it toward a version of yourself that's easier to love — yourself as a child, yourself when you were innocent.

**"I don't want to wish the difficult person well."**
You don't have to mean it perfectly. The practice is about loosening the grip of resentment, not pretending it doesn't exist. Even the intention to try is practice.

### When to Use

- As a daily meditation practice (even 5 minutes counts)
- When you notice your heart closing
- When you're stuck in resentment
- Before a difficult conversation
- When you feel disconnected from others

### The Longer View

This practice isn't about becoming a doormat or pretending everyone is wonderful. It's about recognizing our fundamental interconnection and choosing not to harden against it.

The warmth you cultivate here changes how you move through the world — how you treat strangers, how you react to difficulty, how you hold your own failures. Over time, it becomes less practice and more way of being.
