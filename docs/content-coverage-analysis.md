# Content Coverage Analysis

## Framework Overview

The platform measures development across:
- **4 Pillars**: Mind (8 dimensions), Body (7 dimensions), Soul (8 dimensions), Relationships (9 dimensions)
- **30 Total Dimensions**: Each independently measurable
- **5 Development Stages**: Collapse → Regulation → Integration → Embodiment → Optimization
- **150 Combinations**: 30 dimensions × 5 stages = 150 possible states needing content

## Summary Statistics

| Stage | Full Gaps | Weak Coverage | Moderate+ | Total Dimensions |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Collapse | 7 (23%) | 14 (47%) | 9 (30%) | 30 |
| Regulation | 0 (0%) | 6 (20%) | 24 (80%) | 30 |
| Integration | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 30 (100%) | 30 |
| Embodiment | 0 (0%) | 9 (30%) | 21 (70%) | 30 |
| Optimization | 12 (40%) | 16 (53%) | 2 (7%) | 30 |

**Key Insight**: Integration stage is fully covered. Optimization stage has the most gaps (40% complete gaps). Collapse stage has critical gaps that need addressing.

## Priority Content Needs

### Critical Gaps (Collapse Stage)
These users are in crisis and need immediate support:

1. **movement-capacity (collapse)**: Content for those physically unable to move/exercise due to injury, illness, or deep depression
2. **nourishment (collapse)**: For those in eating disorder crisis or severe food relationship issues
3. **transcendence (collapse)**: Dark night of the soul content, spiritual emergency
4. **creative-expression (collapse)**: When creativity feels completely blocked/dead
5. **spiritual-practice (collapse)**: Spiritual crisis, loss of faith, meaning collapse
6. **empathy-attunement (collapse)**: Complete disconnection from others' experiences

### High Priority (Optimization Stage)
For users at the mastery level:

1. **cognitive-flexibility (optimization)**: Advanced perspective-taking, meta-cognition mastery
2. **thought-patterns (optimization)**: Subtle mind refinement, witnessing consciousness
3. **energy-vitality (optimization)**: Biohacking, peak performance
4. **nourishment (optimization)**: Intuitive eating mastery, relationship with food as art
5. **creative-expression (optimization)**: Creative flow states, prolific creation
6. **life-engagement (optimization)**: Full aliveness, peak experiences regularly
7. **inner-wisdom (optimization)**: Advanced intuition, direct knowing
8. **spiritual-practice (optimization)**: Deep contemplative states, nondual awareness
9. **conflict-repair (optimization)**: Teaching others, mediating disputes
10. **trust-vulnerability (optimization)**: Radical openness, complete trust discernment
11. **empathy-attunement (optimization)**: Advanced empathy, reading subtle cues
12. **social-connection (optimization)**: Building and leading communities

### Medium Priority (Weak Areas)

**Collapse Stage Weak:**
- authenticity (identity crisis content)
- present-moment (when mindfulness fails)
- meaning-purpose (existential crisis)
- life-engagement (complete numbness/depression)
- inner-wisdom (complete disconnection from self)

**Regulation Stage Weak:**
- transcendence (beginning spiritual curiosity)
- creative-expression (unblocking creativity basics)
- spiritual-practice (starting a practice)
- empathy-attunement (learning to read others)

## Content Type Recommendations

### For Collapse Stage Gaps

**Format**: Short articles, crisis guides, immediate practices
**Tone**: Compassionate, non-judgmental, simple steps
**Examples**:
- "When You Can't Get Out of Bed" (movement-capacity collapse)
- "Eating When Eating Feels Impossible" (nourishment collapse)
- "When Your Faith Breaks" (spiritual-practice collapse)

### For Optimization Stage Gaps

**Format**: Advanced courses, mastery guides, nuanced articles
**Tone**: Subtle, sophisticated, assumes competence
**Examples**:
- "The Art of Effortless Conflict Resolution" (conflict-repair optimization)
- "Living in Flow: Beyond Integration" (life-engagement optimization)
- "Advanced Intuition: Trusting the Subtle" (inner-wisdom optimization)

### For Weak Coverage Areas

**Format**: Mix of articles and practice guides
**Tone**: Educational but practical
**Focus**: Bridge content connecting stages

---

## Recommended Content Creation Plan

### Phase 1: Address Collapse Gaps (Critical)
Create 6-10 crisis-appropriate articles/guides:
- Movement when immobilized
- Nourishment basics in crisis
- Spiritual emergency guide
- Creative death and rebirth
- Empathy when disconnected

### Phase 2: Build Optimization Content
Create advanced courses/paths:
- "Mastery Path: From Embodiment to Optimization"
- "Advanced Relational Skills"
- "Peak Performance Integration"
- "Spiritual Depth: Beyond Practice"

### Phase 3: Fill Weak Areas
Targeted articles to strengthen weak cells:
- Beginning spiritual practice guide
- Creative unblocking series
- Advanced empathy training
- Social leadership skills

### Phase 4: Ensure Balance
- One practice per dimension-stage combination
- Pathway content linking stages
- Assessment-linked recommendations

## Tools for Ongoing Analysis

The script at `scripts/analyze-content-coverage.ts` can be run periodically:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/analyze-content-coverage.ts
```

This will:
1. Scan all content files
2. Detect dimension/stage relevance via keywords
3. Generate updated coverage report
4. Identify new gaps

---

## Integration with Custom Learning Paths

The `lib/custom-learning-path.ts` generator should:
1. Identify user's lowest dimensions from assessment
2. Check content availability for that dimension-stage
3. Route to available content, flag gaps
4. Suggest alternative content when gaps exist

When content gaps are encountered, the system should:
- Offer content from adjacent stages
- Suggest generic dimension content
- Flag the gap for admin attention

---

## Success Metrics

Target coverage levels:
- **Collapse**: 80%+ moderate coverage (safety net)
- **Regulation**: 90%+ moderate coverage (foundation)
- **Integration**: 95%+ moderate coverage (core experience)
- **Embodiment**: 80%+ moderate coverage (depth)
- **Optimization**: 60%+ moderate coverage (advanced users smaller segment)

Current vs Target:
| Stage | Current | Target | Gap |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|
| Collapse | 30% | 80% | -50% |
| Regulation | 80% | 90% | -10% |
| Integration | 100% | 95% | +5% |
| Embodiment | 70% | 80% | -10% |
| Optimization | 7% | 60% | -53% |

**Conclusion**: Integration is over-served. Collapse and Optimization are significantly under-served. Priority should be Collapse (safety) then Optimization (retention of advanced users).
