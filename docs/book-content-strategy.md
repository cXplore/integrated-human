# Book Content Strategy

## Platform Context

The Integrated Human platform is built around:
- **4 Pillars**: Mind, Body, Soul, Relationships
- **30 Dimensions**: 7-9 per pillar
- **5 Development Stages**: Collapse → Regulation → Integration → Embodiment → Optimization
- **150 State Combinations**: Each dimension can be at any of 5 stages

The platform already has:
- 200+ articles (free content)
- 92 courses (subscriber content)
- 17 learning paths
- 21 practices (and growing)
- Assessment system measuring all dimensions

## Book Strategy Overview

Books serve as **premium products** that go deeper than courses, providing comprehensive frameworks users can return to repeatedly. They should be:

1. **Standalone valuable** - Work without the platform
2. **Platform-integrated** - Enhanced by the assessment and courses
3. **Evergreen** - Not trend-dependent
4. **Transformation-focused** - Not just information, but implementation
