## Content Philosophy Notes

### Balance Considerations
- Include "what healthy looks like" alongside problem-focused content
- Positive capacities (joy, creativity, vitality) not just wound healing
- Optimization framed as integration, not pressure
- Body/nutrition as understanding, not diet culture

### Voice & Approach
- Direct, practical, no-nonsense
- Psychologically informed but accessible
- Respectful of reader's intelligence
- Not preachy or prescriptive
- Acknowledges complexity

### Integration Focus
- Everything connects to becoming whole
- Body work supports psychological work
- Spirituality grounded in embodiment
- Practical application, not just theory
